Your declaration must explain all the reasons the court should grant the orders you are requesting.</p>\n\n<p>It is your job to give the judge facts, details, dates, description of events, etc. so the judge can reach the conclusion that is most favorable to you. In your declaration, you must answer the question about why the judge should grant the orders you are requesting. On the day of the hearing, you may forget to tell the judge your whole story. So, all the facts and details you want the judge to consider should be stated in your declaration.</p>\n\n<p>Your declaration may be up to 10 pages long,\u00a0doubled spaced using 12 point font. When writing or typing your declaration, keep in mind the judge will have to read this and refer to it at your hearing. Use descriptive headings for your paragraphs. This should tell the judge what the paragraph is about. You should start with the most important issue and the most recent event. When the judge is finished reading your declaration there should be no doubt about what you want, why you want it and why the judge should do what you want.<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Attaching Documents (Exhibits)</h3>\n\n<p>Exhibits are documents that support something you are saying in your declaration. If you believe there are documents the judge should read, you may attach them to your declaration. You must properly describe the document in your declaration by stating what the document is, what exhibit number you have assigned it and why the document is important for the judge to consider, e.g. \u201cAttached as Exhibit 1 is a true and correct copy of my paystubs for the last 3 months showing my gross monthly income is $1550.<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Forms

custody deals with the parents\u2019 right to make the decisions relating to the child\u2019s health, education and welfare.\u00a0 One or both parents can have legal custody.\u00a0 If both parents are making decisions about the child it is called joint legal custody.\u00a0 When writing your declaration you need to explain why it is in the child\u2019s best interest for one or both parents to make these decisions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Physical Custody</strong>: Physical custody deals with the days and times that the child will spend with each parent.\u00a0 If the child primarily lives with one parent it is called physical custody.\u00a0 If you are requesting that both parents spend a substantial period of time with the child, it is called Joint Physical Custody.\u00a0 When writing your declaration you need to explain why your proposed physical custody request is in the child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Visitation</strong>: Visitation is the time\u00a0the child spends with the parent who does not primarily live with the child.\u00a0 When writing your declaration you need to explain why your proposed visitation schedule is in the child\u2019s best interest.\u00a0 There are several options to choose from when it comes to visitation, generally they are: (1) Reasonable Visitation (2) Specific Visitation Schedule (3) Supervised Visitation.\u00a0 <em>Reasonable visitation</em> does not define the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child.\u00a0 A reasonable visitation court order usually works when both parents are in agreement about the time share that each is to have with the child.\u00a0 A <em>specific visitation schedule</em> defines the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child.\u00a0 A specific visitation schedule may be necessary for parents who have a difficult time agreeing on the days and times that each parent will spend with the child.\u00a0 <em>Supervised Visitation</em> requires that a responsible adult be present during any visitation times with the child.\u00a0 A supervised visitation order may be necessary if there are reasonable concerns that a parent may harm the child if left alone.\u00a0 You may request a non-professional or professional supervisor.\u00a0 Click here for more\u00a0information on <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/1190.htm\">Supervised Visitation</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Prevent Child Abduction</strong>:\u00a0 If there are facts that show that the other parent may be thinking of taking the child and hiding the child from you, then you may request orders to prevent the other parent from abducting the child.\u00a0 When writing your declaration you need to explain what the other party has done or plans to do to take and hide the child from you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Child Support</strong>:\u00a0 Both parents are required to financially support the minor child.\u00a0 Child support is the amount of money that one parent pays to the other to equalize the financial responsibility.\u00a0 The amount of child support is arrived by inputting several numbers into a formula.\u00a0 The main factors that are taken into consideration are: (1) Dad\u2019s gross monthly income (2) Mom\u2019s gross monthly income and (3) Percentage of time that is spent with the child.\u00a0 When writing your declaration, you must address each of these factors.\u00a0 The judge needs to know what you are claiming each of these numbers is and also how you arrived at those numbers.\u00a0 Other facts that may be discussed in your declaration are: (1) the other parent\u2019s ability to earn income, (2) the number of other biological children living with you (3) the amount of child care costs per month (4) the amount of rental income received (5) the amount of property taxes and mortgage interest paid per month and (6) the amount paid per month for health insurance premiums.\u00a0 You may attach any supporting documentation to your declaration as exhibits.\u00a0 Be prepared for what the amount of child support might be.\u00a0 Before you file your OSC, the Self-Help Center / Family Law Facilitator may help you calculate the amount of child support or you may go to <a href=\"https://www.cse.ca.gov/ChildSupport/cse/guidelineCalculator\">https://www.cse.ca.gov/ChildSupport/cse/guidelineCalculator</a> to calculate the child support amount on your own.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spousal Support</strong>:\u00a0 (formerly known as \u201cALIMONY\u201d):\u00a0 The judge has discretion to order the payment of spousal support.\u00a0 The judge will consider several factors before deciding whether to award spousal support, the amount of spousal support and the length of time that spousal support will be received.\u00a0 Some of the factors the judge will consider are:\u00a0 (1) Spouse\u2019s ability to pay spousal support (2) Other spouse\u2019s need to receive spousal support and (3) Standard of living during your marriage.\u00a0 When writing your declaration, you must address each of these factors.\u00a0 The judge needs to know what you think your spouse\u2019s income is and how you arrived at that number.\u00a0 In addition, your declaration must give details that describe your standard of living during the marriage which may include the number and kinds of vacations you took together, the kind of home you lived in, the kind of cars you owned, etc.Other factors that you may include in your declaration are the following: (1) Length of marriage (2) Age and health of each spouse (3) How much income each spouse can earn on their own (4) What the expenses of each spouse are (5) The history of the way the couple handled money during the marriage (6) Whether having a job would make it too hard to take care of the children (7) Whether one spouse helped the other get an education, training, career, or professional license (8) Whether there was domestic violence in the marriage or domestic partnership and (9) Whether one spouse's career was affected by unemployment, or by taking care of the children or home.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Attorney's Fees and Costs</strong>:\u00a0\u00a0You may request that the other party pay for your attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u00a0 The judge has discretion to grant or deny this request.\u00a0 When writing your declaration, you must establish in sufficient detail that the other party has the financial ability to pay your attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Property Restraint</strong>:\u00a0 You may request that the other party be prohibited from cashing out 401K\u2019s, checking accounts, savings accounts, etc.\u00a0 When writing your declaration, you must describe why this order is necessary.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Property Control</strong>:\u00a0 You may request an order giving you permission to use a car or live in the house.\u00a0 Your declaration must describe why this order is necessary.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other Relief</strong>:\u00a0 You may request any other relief not already covered.\u00a0 For example, you may request to (1) set aside default (2) change venue (3) reimbursement of half of uninsured health care expenses.\u00a0 Your declaration must describe why this order is necessary.<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Costs Involved</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Filing Fee</strong>: $60 filing fee for the regular Request for Order.\u00a0There is an additional fee of $25 to modify child custody or visitation orders.\u00a0There is an additional fee of $60 to request an ex parte hearing.\u00a0 The court will also charge a first appearance fee of $435 if it was not previously paid or waived. If you wish a record made of the proceedings, you must provide your own court reporter. If you do not have a court reporter present at your hearing, you will not be able to request a transcript of your hearing in the future.\u00a0If you need assistance in obtaining a court-approved list of pro tem reporters, contact the supervising court reporter at (805) 781-1132</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fee Waiver</strong>: If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you may obtain the forms to apply for a fee waiver at any of our Courthouses or you may click the links below.

of the child.\u00a0A specific visitation schedule may be necessary for parents who have a difficult time agreeing on the days and times that each parent will spend with the child.\u00a0Supervised Visitation requires that a responsible adult be present during any visitation times with the child.\u00a0A supervised visitation order may be necessary if there are reasonable concerns that a parent may harm the child if left alone.\u00a0 You may request a non-professional or professional supervisor.\u00a0 Click here for more\u00a0information on <a

Status of Marriage</h3>\n\n<p>Standard: Irreconcilable differences have arisen.\u00a0 If you were married, then the judge will want to know if \u201cirreconcilable differences have arisen leading to the irremediable breakdown of the marriage.\u201d This means that there has been a breakdown of the marriage and that no amount of counseling will reunite the two of you.\u00a0<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">2. Child Custody and Visitation</h3>\n\n<p>Standard:\u00a0 Best Interest of Child.\u00a0 If there are minor children of the marriage, then you will want to explain to the judge what you want and why.\u00a0 If you are requesting no or supervised visitation don\u2019t forget to tell the judge why you believe your proposal is in the best interests of the child or children.<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">3. Child Support / Health insurance / Child Care</h3>\n\n<p>Main Factors to Determine Child Support:\u00a0 Dad\u2019s Income, Mom\u2019s Income, Percentage of Time each Parent.</p>\n\n<p>If you are going to request a specific amount of child support at your default hearing, you may have the Self-Help Center / Family Law Facilitator calculate the possible guideline child support amount or you may want to calculate it on your own at <a href=\"http://www.childsup.ca.gov/\">www.childsup.ca.gov</a>.\u00a0 In order to calculate child support you should bring a copy of your FL-150 Income and Expense Declaration.\u00a0 Also, you will have to make an estimate for the judge as to the other parent\u2019s gross income before taxes.\u00a0 If you tell the judge, \u201cI don\u2019t know what s/he makes,\u201d then the judge will have a difficult time making an order.\u00a0 Remember, you know more about what the other parent earns or is able to earn than the judge does.\u00a0 For this reason, you can describe the other parent\u2019s occupation, experience, etc., and let the judge know what you believe the other parent is capable of earning.\u00a0 The judge can then use this figure in setting the other parent\u2019s earnings.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>At your hearing, you may also request an order that the other parent carry the minor children on health insurance available through the other parent\u2019s employment even if they don\u2019t have insurance now.\u00a0 Note that the judge may make the same order for you that each of you carry the children on insurance that is available at no or reasonable cost through your employment.\u00a0 You may also request that each parent pay one-half of any reasonable health care expenses that are not covered by the insurance.</p>\n\n<p>If you incur child care expenses while you are at work or school, you may request that the other parent pay for one-half of any child care expenses incurred while you are at work or school.</p>\n\n<p>If there is a case with the Department of Child Support Services, you will want to let the judge know this. Bring a copy of the child support order with you to your hearing. If the case is in another county, you will want to tell the judge the name of the other county where the DCSS case is located.<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">4. Spousal Support</h3>\n\n<p>Main Factors:\u00a0 Ability to Pay; Need for Support; Standard of Living During Marriage; Length of Marriage; Age and health of each spouse; How much income each can earn on their own; What the expenses of each spouse are; Whether there are minor children at home; The history of the way the couple handled money during the marriage; What each person needs; What each person pays or can pay (including earnings and earning capacity); Whether having a job would make it too hard to take care of the minor children; Debts and property; Whether one spouse or domestic partner helped the other get an education, training, career, or professional license; Whether there was domestic violence in the marriage or domestic partnership; Whether one spouse's, or domestic partner's, career was affected by unemployment, or by taking care of the children or home, and; The tax impact of spousal support.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to request a specific amount of spousal support, you will need to tell the judge all the facts in your case that are related to the factors listed above.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not ever want spousal support (now or in the future), then let the judge know you are \u201cwaiving\u201d spousal support.\u00a0 If you waive spousal support, you will never be able to ask for spousal support in the future, even if you need it.\u00a0 If you have a marriage of 10 years or more the court will want you to explain why this is a reasonable request.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not ever want to pay spousal support to the other party, then let the judge know that you want to \u201cterminate jurisdiction\u201d over the issue of spousal support.\u00a0 If you have a marriage of 10 years or more the court will want you to explain why this is a reasonable request.</p>\n\n<p>If you want the court to make spousal support orders in the future, then let the judge know that you want to \u201creserve jurisdiction\u201d over the issue of spousal support.<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">5. Assets and Debts</h3>\n\n<p>Standard: Equal Division of Community Property and Debt.\u00a0 Remember that community property is defined as any asset or debt that was purchased or incurred after date of marriage and before date of separation.\u00a0 There are some exceptions to this rule, such as gifts or inheritance.\u00a0 Generally, in a default hearing the court wants to be able to divide that community property assets and debts equally between the parties.</p>\n\n<p>If there are assets or debts to be divided by the judge, you should review the FL-160 Property Declaration(s) that you previously completed.\u00a0 If you are requesting that the community property assets and debts be divided unequally, you will need to tell the judge why your unequal proposal for division is a fair and equitable division.</p>\n\n<p>If you are requesting that the court divide a pension or retirement plan then you may need to seek legal advice from an attorney before you get divorced. In most cases, the pension plan will not be able to disburse any money until a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) is signed by the judge.\u00a0 In addition, if the employee spouse dies before a QDRO is signed then the pension will not pay out any money to the spouse.<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">6. Restoring of your Former Name</h3>\n\n<p>If you want the judge to order that your name be restored to your former name, be sure to request this at the time of your hearing.</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>"], "_type": "Superior Court of California - County of San Lui2"}
