The first is \"irreconcilable differences\", meaning that at least one party asserts that the marriage cannot be saved. The other reason is \"incurable insanity\" which, unlike irreconcilable differences, must be proven.\n\n<p><strong>Dissolution of Marriage (Divorce)</strong>: A dissolution of marriage, which is more commonly known as divorce, terminates the marriage and resolves marital issues including child custody, visitation, child support, spousal support, asset and debt division (real and personal property), former name restoration, restraining orders, and other issues identified by the parties.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary Dissolution</strong>: If you and your spouse are in agreement that you want to divorce you may be able to obtain a summary dissolution. The criteria for a summary dissolution include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>You were married for under five years,</li>\n\t<li>There were no children born during the marriage,</li>\n\t<li>You have very few community assets and debts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For more information about this option, which is less complicated than a regular dissolution of marriage, Click here.</p></p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            LEGAL SEPARATION\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>Legal separation is similar to dissolution of marriage, except that the parties remain married to each other. The court may make orders regarding the same issues identified in a dissolution of marriage.\n\n<p>If you open a legal separation action, you may amend your petition prior to judgment to request a dissolution of marriage.

Fee Waiver forms and information can be found here.</p>\n\n<p>If you are applying for a guardianship of the person and are related to the child you are asking for guardianship of, there may also be a fee for the guardianship investigation. A guardianship investigation is performed by the Probation Department a month or two after the guardianship petition is filed. A guardianship investigator will visit you, walk through your home, and ask questions about why the guardianship is needed.

The State, as the protector of all the people, makes the charge against someone accused of committing a crime because a crime is considered an act against society. Only the State, through the office of the District Attorney in each county, can charge individuals with criminal violations. The prosecuting attorney presents the charge against the accused person (defendant) on behalf of the State (plaintiff), and must prove to the judge or jury that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n<p>California statutes generally classify a crime as either a felony or a misdemeanor. A felony is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment in a state prison or by death. A misdemeanor is a lesser offense than a felony and generally is punishable by fine or imprisonment in county jail rather than in a state penitentiary.</p>\n\n<p>If you are the victim of a crime, there are resources available to you.

If the tenant wins, the landlord may have to pay the tenant a lot of money. Even if the landlord wins this lawsuit, the lawyer fees can be very high. That's why it is very important that both landlords and tenants follow all the legal procedures properly.</p></p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\n                    \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        <strong>Security Deposit FAQS:</strong>\n        \n            \n            \n                expand all collapse all \n            \n            <br/>\n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            WHAT IS A SECURITY DEPOSIT?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>A security deposit is any money a landlord takes from a tenant in case the property is damaged, including \"pet deposits\" or \"last month's rent\".</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            HOW MUCH CAN A SECURITY DEPOSIT BE?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>If security deposit is for a residential property without furniture, the security deposit may equal 2 times the rent.\n\n<p>If the residence is furnished the landlord may charge up to 3 times the rent.</p>\n\n<p>There is no restriction on the amount of the security deposit for the rental of a commercial property.</p></p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            DOES A SECURITY DEPOSIT HAVE TO BE RETURNED?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>If a tenant damages the property, the landlord can deduct the cost of fixing it from the security deposit.

The first is \"irreconcilable differences\", meaning that at least one party asserts that the marriage cannot be saved. The other reason is \"incurable insanity\" which, unlike irreconcilable differences, must be proven.\n\n<p><strong>Dissolution of Marriage (Divorce)</strong>: A dissolution of marriage, which is more commonly known as divorce, terminates the marriage and resolves marital issues including child custody, visitation, child support, spousal support, asset and debt division (real and personal property), former name restoration, restraining orders, and other issues identified by the parties.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary Dissolution</strong>: If you and your spouse are in agreement that you want to divorce you may be able to obtain a summary dissolution. The criteria for a summary dissolution include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>You were married for under five years,</li>\n\t<li>There were no children born during the marriage,</li>\n\t<li>You have very few community assets and debts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For more information about this option, which is less complicated than a regular dissolution of marriage, Click here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Legal Separation</strong>: Legal separation is similar to dissolution of marriage, except that the parties remain married to each other. The court may make orders regarding the same issues identified in a dissolution of marriage.</p>\n\n<p>If you open a legal separation action, you may amend your petition prior to judgment to request a dissolution of marriage. That will allow you to \"start the clock\" on the waiting period for divorce (six months from date of service), provided that you follow some special instructions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nullity</strong>: A nullity is more commonly known as an annulment of marriage. This may only be requested if a party alleges incest, bigamy, minor without parental consent, unsound mind, fraud, force or incapacity to consummate marriage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Domestic Partnerships</strong>: Dissolution of a domestic partnership terminates the partnership. You must be a resident of the state of California, both parties do not have to agree to the dissolution and it takes a minimum of six months for this action to become final.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Child and Spousal Support</strong>: To obtain or modify family support orders, establish parentage, or enforce existing family support orders, the Department of Child Support Services is available to assist you. Information concerning this office is available at www.childsup.ca.gov.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Adoptions: Private and Stepparent</strong>: Before granting a petition for adoption, the court authorizes an investigation of the adoptive parents(s), regardless of whether they are related to the children or stepparents. Parties are required to pay for these investigations. Typically, the court will also consider petitions to terminate parental rights of the parent(s) who are relinquishing their children in this process.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Domestic Violence</strong>: Parties alleging domestic violence may file for a Domestic Violence Restraining Order. Domestic violence forms that you can complete on line are available at http://www.courts.ca.gov/1271.htm. Or click here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Establishment of Parental Relationship</strong>: These are also called \"paternity cases\". The court may make findings or parental relationship in these matters that will have an effect on child support. visitation and custody.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Child Custody, Support and Visitation</strong>: Even after marital and domestic partnership issues have been resolved, the court retains jurisdiction over issues that affect minor children in these proceedings until these children reach 18 years of age (or 19 years of age if still in high school). Parties may file motions to modify custody, support and visitation any time the circumstances warrant such filings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Emancipation of Minors</strong>: A minor may petition the court for a declaration of emancipation if the minor is at least 14 years of age, willingly lives separately from parents, and managing his own personal financial affairs.</p></p>"], "parent": ["https://www.humboldt.courts.ca.gov/sh/index.htm"], "_template": "f760-426d-a862", "url": "https://www.humboldt.courts.ca.gov/sh/familylaw.htm", "_type": "page"},

By using ADR you may not have to file a lawsuit, and if you do file a lawsuit, you may be able to avoid a trial.

The court recognizes the value of early case intervention and the use of alternative dispute resolution options for amenable and eligible cases. The use of ADR will be discussed at all case management and pre-trial conferences. It is the court's expectation that litigants will utilize some form of ADR - i.e. the court's mediation and arbitration programs or other available private ADR options in an attempt to settle a case before trial.\n\n<p>The court also provides litigants with information about ADR and a list of mediators which litigants can choose from if they want to try to resolve their case through mediation. The list of mediators is available on this website, or by contacting the court's ADR Coordinator. You can also contact the court's ADR Coordinator for further information about the court's civil mediation program.</p></p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            3. WHAT TYPES OF ADR ARE AVAILABLE IN CIVIL CASES?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>The most commonly used ADR processes are mediation, arbitration, settlement conferences and neutral evaluation.\n\n<p><strong>Mediation</strong><br/>\nIn mediation, an impartial person called a \"mediator,\" helps the parties try to reach a mutually acceptable resolution of the dispute. The mediator does not decide the dispute but helps the parties communicate so they can try to settle the dispute themselves. Mediation leaves control of the outcome with the parties.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Arbitration</strong><br/>\nIn arbitration, a neutral person called an \"arbitrator\", hears arguments and evidence from each side and then decides the outcome of the dispute. Arbitration is less formal than a trial, and the rules of evidence are often relaxed. Arbitration may be either \"binding\" or \"nonbinding.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Settlement Conferences</strong><br/>\nSettlement conferences may be either mandatory or voluntary. In both types of settlement conferences, the parties and their attorneys meet with a judge (or a temporary judge) to discuss possible settlement of their dispute. The judge does not make a decision in the case but assists the parties in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the case and in negotiating a settlement. Mandatory settlement conferences are often held close to the date a case is set for trial.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Neutral Evaluation</strong><br/>\nIn neutral evaluation, each party gets a chance to present the case to a neutral person called an \"evaluator\". The evaluator then gives an opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of each party's evidence and arguments and about how the dispute could be resolved. The evaluator is often an expert in the subject matter of the dispute. The evaluator's opinion is not binding, but the parties typically use it as a basis for trying to negotiate a resolution to the dispute. At this time, the Humboldt County Superior Court does not have a formal Neutral Evaluation process in place, although parties may elect to use these services on their own.</p></p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            4. HOW IS THE ADR PROCESS INITIATED?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>A mediation process may be initiated by the parties at any time after all parties have appeared in the case, by filing a Stipulation to Mediate form. The court can provide you with a list of mediators that you can choose from. The list of mediators is available on this website, or by contacting the court's ADR Coordinator. You can also contact the court's ADR Coordinator for further information about the court's civil mediation program.\n\n<p>If the parties do not otherwise agree to use ADR, these options will be discussed at the Case Management Conference, which is held approximately 120 after the case is filed. It is the court's expectation that litigants will utilize some form of ADR such as the court's mediation and arbitration programs or other available private ADR options for case settlement before trial. The court may refer (on a voluntary basis) cases to arbitration or civil mediation. In certain cases, the court may order parties to judicial arbitration or a settlement conference.</p></p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            5.

Mediation is a flexible and less formal process that may reduce the time and costs often associated with a formal trial.</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            11.

So when family members, neighbors, or business partners have a dispute, mediation may be the ADR process to use. Mediation is also effective when emotions are getting in the way of resolution. An effective mediator can hear the parties and help them communicate with each other in an effective and constructive manner</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            12.

{"title": ["Probate and Conservatorship"], "body": ["<p>Probate is the court supervised process of identifying and gathering a person's assets after their death, paying all of their debts, and distributing the balance to the rightful heirs or beneficiaries. If an estate exceeds $100,000.00, and if the assets are in the name of the deceased person only, a probate will generally be required.\n\n<p>A conservatorship can be set up after a judge decides that an adult person (called the \"conservatee\") can't take care of themselves or their finances. Then the judge chooses another person or organization (called the \"conservator\") to be in charge of the conservatee's care or finances, or both.</p></p>\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\n\n\n    \n        <strong>Probate Frequently Asked Questions</strong>\n        \n            \n            \n                expand all collapse all \n            \n            <br/>\n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            WHAT IF PROBATE IS NOT REQUIRED?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>There are many situations where an estate does not require probate, including estates under $100,000.00, estates in trust, and those cases where all of the estate passes to a surviving spouse. Even when probate is not required, however, some sort of legal process is often necessary. This is especially true when an estate owns an interest in real property. Legal counsel is recommended if you have any questions regarding estate matters.</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            MUST I ATTEND COURT TO INHERIT DECEASED PERSON'S PROPERTY?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>Not always. If you have the legal right to inherit personal property, like money in a bank account or stocks, the entire estate is worth $100,000 or less, and there is no real property (land) in the estate you may not have to go to court. There is a simplified process that can sometimes be used to transfer the property to your name. This process generally cannot be used for real property like a house. The Affidavit Procedure for Collection or Transfer of Personal Property can be found in the Probate Code under Section &sect;13100.

For certain serious crimes, the law currently provides the possibility of trying juveniles as adults in the Adult Criminal Court.\n\n<p>Parents or guardians have the right to receive a copy of the delinquency petition, stating the delinquent acts the child is accused of committing. The petition does not prove that the minor committed these acts and there will be opportunities at court hearings to present evidence regarding the minor's involvement in the alleged criminal acts.</p>\n\n<p>For those who cannot afford legal representation for their children, the Court will appoint an attorney. Please note that this attorney represents the child only and will not represent the parents or guardians.</p>\n\n<p>The objectives of the Delinquency Court are to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Protect the minor;</li>\n\t<li>Give guidance to the minor;</li>\n\t<li>Punish minors who commit delinquent acts, and;</li>\n\t<li>Ensure the safety of the community.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If a minor becomes a ward of the Delinquency Court, the Court will make orders for the parents or guardians and the minor. The minor may be allowed to live in the parents' or guardians' home under Court supervision or may be placed outside of the home in an unlocked or locked facility.

A contested trial will be scheduled within 45 days. You may waive your right to a speedy trial and have it scheduled within a reasonable amount of time. While many individuals with a good record may be released on their promise to appear, the court may require bail to be posted to secure appearance at trial, particularly if you have previous failures to appear or pay.<br/>\nAt your trial, the officer who issued the citation will testify as a witness. If there are other witnesses, they may also be called to testify.<br/>\nAt the trial you may question (cross-examine) the witnesses. You may testify yourself and / or call witnesses to testify. After the evidence is presented the judge may rule immediately whether you are guilty or not guilty or the case may be taken under submission before deciding. If the case is taken under submission, you will be notified of the ruling by mail or you may choose to return to court.<br/>\nIf you are found not guilty, that is the end of the case. If you are found guilty, the judge will determine how much the fine will be. The fine may be more or less than the bail originally quoted in your case depending on the facts which were presented. If your driving record shows previous convictions, the fine may increase substantially and your driver's license may be suspended for up to 6 months.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Trials - Trial by Written Declaration </strong>\u2013 This option is for Vehicle Code infraction violations only and does not require a personal appearance. A Trial by Written Declaration requires you to post bail in lieu of your appearance. The total bail amount due as well as the Fee for Traffic School must be posted in full before the process will begin.

If you are not in immediate danger but need protection from harm or harassment, you may apply for a temporary restraining order.
