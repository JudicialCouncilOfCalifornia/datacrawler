<p>Felony appeals are filed after the order of judgment/sentencing.  Please refer to the California Rules of Court for specific time requirements.</p><p class="drill-down-display">An appeal is a review of the trial court's decision by another court.&nbsp; A party may appeal an unfavorable judgment and certain orders. An appeal is not a retrial.&nbsp; You will not be permitted to introduce new evidence, and the appellate court will not reassess conflicting evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; The party who files the appeal is called the appellant.&nbsp; The opposing parties are the respondents.</p>Listed below is the procedure, pursuant to the California Rules of Court, from the time the appeal is filed until the final decision of the Court of Appeal is issued by remittitur.<p></p><p class="drill-down-display">The Notice of Appeal must be filed with the Appeals Division before the filing deadline.&nbsp; For example, the Notice of Appeal in a felony case must be filed within 60 calendar days after sentencing [CRC 8.308}.&nbsp; To find the filing deadline for your case, see the California Rules of Court, Rules 8.1-8.793.</p>Only a person or entity that was a party in the trial court proceeding can appeal a decision in that proceeding.&nbsp; You may not appeal on behalf of a friend, a spouse, a child, or another relative unless you are a legally appointed representative for that person (such as a guardian or conservator).<p></p><ul class="bullets">
		<li><b>Notice of Appeal</b>: To appeal from a judgment or an appealable order of the superior court in a felony case, the defendant or the People must file a notice of appeal in that superior court.The notice of appeal must be signed by the appellant's attorney or the appellant if not represented.</li>
		<li><b>Notice to Court Reporter(s)</b>: The clerk of the superior court shall notice any court reporter(s) for transcripts of hearings not already filed with the court that constitute part of the normal record pursuant to the California Rules of Court. In most cases, the court reporter is given 20 days to complete the transcripts, unless an extension of time is requested from the Court of Appeal.</li>
		<li><b>Clerk's Transcript</b>: Once the appeal has been filed and processed, the clerk of the superior court shall prepare the clerk's transcript to consist of all documents that constitute a normal part of the record pursuant to the California Rules of Court.</li>
		<li><b>Transmittal</b>: Upon completion of the clerk's and/or reporter's transcripts, the original record shall be certified to the Court of Appeal and copies mailed to all appropriate parties.</li>
		<li><b>Appointment of Counsel</b>: Appellant, otherwise called the Respondent if the People have appealed, may request that counsel be appointed to represent them on appeal.</li>
		<li><b>Appellant's Opening Brief</b>: An opening brief shall be served and filed with the reviewing court.  Please see the California Rules of Court for specific time requirements.</li>
		<li><b>Respondent's Brief</b>: The respondent's brief shall be served and filed after the appellant's opening brief is filed.  Please refer to the California Rules of Court for specific time requirements.</li>
		<li><b>Appellant's Reply Brief</b>: The appellant may serve and file a reply brief after the respondent files its brief.  Please refer to the California Rules of Court for specific time requirements.</li>
		<li><b>Opinion</b>: Upon decision of the reviewing court, a written opinion is filed and copies sent to all appropriate parties. The opinion becomes final, providing there are no pending reviews of the case in the Supreme Court.</li>
		<li><b>Remittitur</b>: The remittitur is the final decision of the reviewing court and is deemed issued when the clerk enters it in the record. The clerk of the superior court must immediately send file-stamped copies to all parties involved. If a change in judgment, modifications, or further proceedings have been ordered, the clerk of the superior court shall proceed accordingly.</li></ul><b>Fees</b><br>The filing fees for the Notice of Appeal can be found on the courtâ€™s fee schedule.&nbsp; Checks or money orders should be made payable to Superior Court of California, County of Tulare.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; There is a separate filing fee of $755 to be paid to the Court of Appeal.<br>If you cannot afford to pay the filing fees and other court costs, you may qualify for a waiver of those costs. Fee Waiver forms are located under Forms, Fee &amp; Rules.<br><b>Presently on the Unlimited Civil Cases section (see below) on the web site the fee amount for the Court of Appeal presently reflects the fee as $655.00 and needs to be updated to reflect the fee as $755.00.</b><ul class="bullets">

	<ul class="bullets">
		<li><b>Notice of Appeal</b>: To appeal from a superior court judgment or appealable order, the appellant must serve and file a notice of appeal in that superior court. The notice of appeal must be signed by the appellant's attorney or the appellant if not represented.</li>

		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Reporter's Transcript</b>: After filing the notice of appeal, the appellant must serve and file in superior court either a notice designating a reporter's transcript or a notice of intent to proceed without a reporter's transcript.

<div class="drill-down-hidden" id="drill-misdemeanor-cases">

<p>Appeals in most misdemeanor criminal  cases are heard in the Appellate  Division of the Superior
Court.  The procedures  for presenting an appeal are contained  in the California Rules of Court (rule
8.850 and following). An appeal is not a new trial.  The appellate panel will not re-hear the presentation of evidence.</p>

<p>The time for filing an appeal is limited. You must act promptly. In misdemeanor cases a Notice of Appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days after the judgment  or order appealed from (See CRC
8.853(a).)</p>

<p>Instructions and further information are contained  in the Judicial Council Form CR-131-INFOÂ­ Information on Appeal Procedures for Misdemeanors. The required  form for Notice of Appeal is Form CR-132- Notice of Appeal (Misdemeanor).  These forms are available through the clerk's office and from the California Courts web site.</p>

<p>Once all of the documents required to support  the appeal have been filed, the appeal will be set for hearing before the appellate  panel.  The panel consists of three Superior Court judges assigned by the Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court to serve on the appellate  panel.  In our court, appeals are heard once a month. You will receive written notice of the date and time of your appeal hearing and of the deadline  for filing any briefs (written legal arguments) you may want the appellate  panel to review.</p>

<p>At the appeal hearing, each party will be provided  with a limited time to explain why the trial court proceedings  were or were not in error, called oral argument. At the conclusion of oral argument, the panel will announce a decision or may take the matter under submission.  If taken under submission, a written ruling  will be prepared  and mailed  to you, usually within  30 days of the appeal hearing.</p>

	<ul class="bullets">
		<li><b>Settlement</b>: If a civil case settles after a notice of appeal has been filed, the appellant must immediately serve and file a notice of settlement in the Court of Appeal. If a clerk's and reporter's transcripts have been designated and the record has not been filed in the Court of Appeal, the appellant must also immediately serve a copy of the notice on the superior court clerk.</li>
		<li><b>Abandonment</b>: Before the record is filed in the Court of Appeal, the appellant may serve and file in superior court an abandonment of the appeal or a stipulation to abandon the appeal. The filing effects a dismissal of the appeal and restores the superior court's jurisdiction. The superior court clerk must promptly notify the Court of Appeal and the parties of the abandonment or stipulation.</li>
		<li><b>Request to Dismiss</b>: After the record is filed in the Court of Appeal, the appellant may serve and file in that court a request or a stipulation to dismiss the appeal. On receipt of a request or stipulation to dismiss, the court may dismiss the appeal and direct immediate issuance of the remittitur.</li>
		<li><b>Approval of Compromise</b>: If a guardian or conservator seeks approval of a proposed compromise of a pending appeal, the Court of Appeal may, before ruling on the compromise, direct the trial court to determine whether the compromise is in the minor's or conservatee's best interests and to report its findings.</li>
