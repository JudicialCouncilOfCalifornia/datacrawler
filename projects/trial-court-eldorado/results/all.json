unfavorable judgment and certain orders.\u00a0 Generally, the appeal must be based on an argument that a legal error was made by the trial court.</p>\r\n                          <p>You should consult with an attorney as soon as possible before you file an appeal because the law imposes strict timelines for filing an appeal.\u00a0 In some instances, you may qualify for a Court appointed attorney to handle your appeal.</p>\r\n                          <p>An appeal is not a retrial.\u00a0 You will not be permitted to introduce new evidence, and the appellate court will not reassess conflicting evidence.</p>\r\n                          <p>You may not appeal on behalf of a friend, a spouse, a child, or other relative (unless you are a legally appointed guardian).</p>\r\n                          <p>The party filing the appeal is called the appellant.\u00a0 The opposing parties are the respondents.</p>\r\n                          <p>NOTE: The information contained in this page does not

The first step in filing a small claims action is to make a verbal or written request for payment. If a verbal demand is made, it should be followed up with a letter. To establish jurisdiction, the action must have occurred in El Dorado County, or the defendant\u2019s (the person you are filing against) principal place of business or residence must be in El Dorado County. The maximum claim allowed in small claims court is $10,000. A plaintiff is limited to two small claims filings over $2,500 per year. What is the fee to file a small claims? Filing claim for $1,500 or less $30 Filing claim for more than $1,500 but less than or equal to $5,000 $50 Filing claim for more than $5,000 but less than or equal to $10,000 (claim by natural persons only) $75 Filing claim by person who has filed more than 12 small claims in California within the previous 12 months $100 You must submit the original and at least 2 copies of your small claims filing. If filed by mail, you must provide a self-addressed stamped envelope for return of your documents. All documents must be assembled and stapled in the upper left hand corner. If you want the Court to notify the defendant by certified mail, there is an additional charge of $15.00 per defendant. How do I notify the other party? Before the court can exercise jurisdiction over the person (have the power to order the defendant to do something), the defendant must be aware of the lawsuit and be given an opportunity to defend the claim. The papers must be served on the defendant by personal delivery or certified mail by the court. This is called due process , a fundamental right guaranteed in the Constitution. It means that the government will not take away rights, liberty or property without first notifying the person who is to lose those rights, and giving him or her the right to appear and object. The rules governing notice to a defendant require strict compliance. How do I serve the other party? The correct way to notify a defendant about a lawsuit is by service of process. This means that a copy of the complaint filed in the court must be given to the defendant by one of the following means: Personal service. You may ask anyone who is not a party in your case and who is at least 18 years old to serve (give) a copy of the court papers on the defendant. Personal services means the person personally gave a copy of the court papers to the defendant. Substituted service. Substituted service occurs when a person other than the defendant is served on the defendant\u2019s behalf so long as the papers are served (i) at the defendant\u2019s business with the person in charge; or (ii) at the defendant\u2019s home with a competent person who is at least 18 years old. The person who receives the court papers must be told about their contents. Another copy of the same court papers must be mailed, first class, postage prepaid, to the defendant at the address where the paper was left. The service is not complete until 10 days after the copy is mailed. Certified mail. For small claims cases only , you may ask the Clerk of the Court to serve the defendant by certified mail. The clerk will charge a fee of $15.00 for this service. You should check back with the court prior to the hearing to see if the receipt for certified mail was returned to the court. Service by certified mail can only be accomplished by the Clerk of the Court. The person who completes service as stated above must complete the Proof of Service form, Judicial Council Form SC-104, and have it filed with the Court. PROOF OF SERVICE MUST BE FILED WITH THE COURT FIVE (5) DAYS PRIOR TO THE HEARING DATE. If there is no proof of service on file the matter may be continued or will be automatically dropped from the Court\u2019s calendar. The Plaintiff must then request the matter be reset. YOU CANNOT SERVE PAPERS ON THE DEFENDANT YOURSELF. YOU MUST USE A NON-PARTY. Professional process servers are available for hire, and the sheriff\u2019s department may also serve legal papers for a fee. The defendant must be served at least 15 days before the trial date if he or she lives in the county, and at least 20 days if the defendant lives outside the county. If service is not completed in time, the trial will be continued (postponed). If service is accomplished by substituted service or by certified mail, you must allow 10 ten additional days. How do I prepare my case? You may prepare your own case, or consult with an attorney about the applicable law and preparation for trial. You may also receive assistance from the small claims advisor 1-800-815-2947. If you prepare the case yourself, you may wish to research the legal theory by which you are seeking relief from the court. There are books available in the El Dorado County Law Library at 550 Main Street in Placerville, which explain different legal theories and the elements necessary to prove your case. Small claims court is informal, so you do not have to know the law; however it will improve your chances for success if you can distill the essential elements of the case and present them to the court in a clear and concise manner. The opposing side is entitled to see all evidence before it is submitted to the court; therefore, if you plan to bring documents to show the court, you need to make extra copies for the other side, and for the judge. It will save time if you can each have a copy to refer to in court. Be sure you are on time for the trial. Although the small claims trial is informal, you must be prepared with witnesses, books, receipts and other documents needed to prove your case. If your witnesses are not willing to come to court voluntarily, you can request that the court clerk issue a subpoena . A subpoena is a court order that requires the witness to appear. The witness has a right to charge a fee for appearing. If you do not have in your possession the records or papers necessary to prove your case, you may request the court clerk issue a subpoena duces tecum in advance of the trial date, which orders the documents you are requesting be delivered to court for trial. Many cases are scheduled for the same time, so each case is given limited time. You should describe the events clearly and concisely. Before you present to the court any photographs, diagrams or documents, you must first show them to the opposing side. If possible, observe other small claims proceedings in the same department or courtroom where your case is scheduled, prior to the day you are to appear. You will get an idea how to proceed in an organized manner due to the limited time available for each case. What if I need an interpreter? You may ask a friend, relative, or someone else to interpret for you when you go to court. Please do not ask a child (minor, under the age of 18) to interpret for you. A Court interpreter needs to be familiar with legal terms and concepts in both English and your first language. If you decide to use a friend or relative, have the person read the instructions and duties for interpreting called Foreign Language Interpreter\u2019s Duties-Civil and Small Claims . To find an interpreter that speaks your language visit https://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-interpreter.htm What important rules to know? You must present your case to the Judge. You may not bring your attorney, paralegal or other legal advisor to the hearing. You must not interrupt any party that is speaking. Each witness is given time to speak. Locate your counterpart and exchange all documents. If you only have one set, they are entitled to see it before court. No talking in the courtroom once the room is called to order. No children are allowed in the courtroom. The Court has a dress code and it is enforced. Dress as you would for a job interview in professional business attire. Review the Local Rules of Court for Small Claims prior to your hearings. Local Rules are available on the Court\u2019s web site or are available at the clerk's office for a fee. Where do I get the forms to file a claim?

The papers must be served on the defendant by personal  delivery or certified mail by the court.\u00a0 This is called <strong>due process</strong>,  a fundamental right guaranteed in the Constitution. It means that the  government will not take away rights, liberty or property without first  notifying the person who is to lose those rights, and giving him or her the  right to appear and object. The rules governing notice to a defendant require  strict compliance.</p>\r\n<div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n                          \r\n                   \r\n                   \r\n                   \r\n                   \r\n                          <div class=\"trigger2\">How do I serve the other party?</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                      <p>\r\nThe correct way to notify a defendant about a lawsuit is by service of process. This means that a copy of the complaint filed in the court must be given to the defendant by one of the following means:\r\n\r\n</p><ul class=\"square2\">\r\n   <li><strong>Personal service.</strong> You may ask anyone who is not a       party in your case and who is at least 18 years old to <strong>serve</strong> (give)       a copy of the court papers on the defendant. \u00a0Personal services means       the person personally gave a copy of the court papers to the       defendant.\u00a0 </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul class=\"square2\">\r\n     <li><strong>Substituted service. \u00a0</strong>Substituted service occurs when a       person other than the defendant is served on the defendant\u2019s behalf so       long as the papers are served (i) at the defendant\u2019s business with the       person in charge; or (ii) at the defendant\u2019s home with a competent person       who is at least 18 years old. The person who receives the court papers       must be told about their contents. Another copy of the same court papers       must be mailed, first class, postage prepaid, to the defendant at the       address where the paper was left. The service is not complete until 10       days after the copy is mailed. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul class=\"square2\">\r\n     <li><strong>Certified mail.</strong> <u>For small claims cases only</u>,       you may ask the Clerk of the Court to serve the defendant by certified       mail. The clerk will charge a fee of $15.00 for this service. You should       check back with the court prior to the hearing to see if the receipt for       certified mail was returned to the court. Service by certified mail can only       be accomplished by the Clerk of the Court. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul class=\"square2\">\r\n     <li>The person who completes service       as stated above must complete the Proof of Service form, Judicial Council       Form SC-104, and have it filed with the Court.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>PROOF OF SERVICE MUST BE FILED WITH THE COURT  FIVE (5) DAYS PRIOR TO THE HEARING DATE.\u00a0 If there is no proof of service  on file the matter may be continued or will be automatically dropped from the  Court\u2019s calendar.\u00a0 The Plaintiff must then request the matter be reset.</strong></p><br>\r\n<p><strong>YOU CANNOT SERVE PAPERS ON THE DEFENDANT YOURSELF.  YOU MUST USE A NON-PARTY. \u00a0</strong>Professional process servers are available for  hire, and the sheriff\u2019s department may also serve legal papers for a fee. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  The defendant must be served at least 15 days  before the trial date if he or she lives in the county, and at least 20 days if  the defendant lives outside the county. If service is not completed in time,  the trial will be <strong>continued</strong> (postponed).\u00a0 If service is  accomplished by substituted service or by certified mail, you must allow 10 ten  additional days. </p>\r\n<div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n                          \r\n                   \r\n                   \r\n                   \r\n                   \r\n                          <div class=\"trigger2\">How do I prepare my case?    </div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                          <p>You may prepare your own case, or consult with  an attorney about the applicable law and preparation for trial. You may also  receive assistance from the small claims advisor 1-800-815-2947.</p>\r\n                          <p>If you prepare the case yourself, you may wish  to research the legal theory by which you are seeking relief from the court.  There are books available in the El Dorado County Law Library at 550 Main  Street in Placerville, which explain different legal theories and the elements  necessary to prove your case. Small claims court is informal, so you do not  have to know the law; however it will improve your chances for success if you  can distill the essential elements of the case and present them to the court in  a clear and concise manner.</p>\r\n                          <p>The opposing side is entitled to see all  evidence before it is submitted to the court; therefore, if you plan to bring  documents to show the court, you need to make extra copies for the other side,  and for the judge. It will save time if you can each have a copy to refer to in  court.</p>\r\n                          <p>Be sure you are on time for the trial. Although  the small claims trial is informal, you must be prepared with witnesses, books,  receipts and other documents needed to prove your case. If your witnesses are  not willing to come to court voluntarily, you can request that the court clerk  issue a <strong>subpoena</strong>. A subpoena is a court order that requires the witness  to appear. The witness has a right to charge a fee for appearing. If you do not  have in your possession the records or papers necessary to prove your case, you  may request the court clerk issue a <strong>subpoena <em>duces tecum</em></strong>in  advance of the trial date, which orders the documents you are requesting be  delivered to court for trial.</p>\r\n                          <p>Many cases are scheduled for the same time, so  each case is given limited time. You should describe the events clearly and  concisely. Before you present to the court any photographs, diagrams or  documents, you must first show them to the opposing side. If possible, observe  other small claims proceedings in the same department or courtroom where your  case is scheduled, prior to the day you are to appear. You will get an idea how  to proceed in an organized manner due to the limited time available for each  case.</p>\r\n<div class=\"cleaner\"></div>\r\n                  \t</div>\r\n                          \r\n                   \r\n                   \r\n                   \r\n                   \r\n                          <div class=\"trigger2\">What if I need an interpreter?   </div>\r\n                    <div class=\"triggerContent2\">\r\n                           <p>You may ask a friend,  relative, or someone else to interpret for you when you go to court.

The Court and its staff shall employ all necessary and appropriate means to ensure that citizens fulfill this important and civic duty.\u201d  Postponing jury service is preferred to excusing a prospective juror.

NOTE: If the juror is under 70 years old, he/she must obtain a statement from a doctor that clearly states that the juror cannot serve jury duty for medical reasons.  Doctor\u2019s note must indicate the expected length of infirmity, or if permanent, must state so.</li>\r\n<li>The prospective juror has served on a grand or trial jury within the preceding 12 months.</li>\r\n<li>The prospective juror is serving on active military duty</li>\r\n<li>The prospective juror would suffer an extreme financial burden.
