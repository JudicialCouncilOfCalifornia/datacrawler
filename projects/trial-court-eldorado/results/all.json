When your CCRC appointment is scheduled, you will be given a questionnaire requesting information about you, your children, your concerns, your proposals, and other pertinent information. You must fill out this questionnaire and turn it in prior to the CCRC appointment.</p>\r\n            <p>If you want to meet separately with the Child Custody Recommending Counselor (Recommending Counselor), you may request this at the Clerk\u2019s Office or from the Recommending Counselor. </p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>If you live more than 120 miles away from the courthouse where you are ordered to appear, or have a documented medical condition that prohibits you from traveling, you may request Telephonic Appearance at Child Custody Recommending Counseling by filling out Local form F-102 at least 5 days before your Child Custody Recommending Counseling appointment. </p>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n           <br>\r\n              <h3>WHAT HAPPENS IN CCRC</h3>\r\n            <p>CCRC is problem solving and fact finding, not therapy. Your disagreement is seen as a problem to solve, not as a fight. The Child Custody Recommending Counselor lets you make your own decisions if possible. In CCRC, you can come up with your own personal contract on how you will care for your children. The legal term for this personal contract is an agreement or stipulation. It can also be called a \u201cparenting plan\u201d or a \u201cparenting agreement.\u201d The Recommending Counselor will write up your agreement and the judge will sign it at your court date. If you do not agree, the Recommending Counselor will ask questions using a fact-gathering interview style to gain knowledge and information about concerns each parent raises. Your child(ren) may be interviewed later, at the discretion of the Recommending Counselor. The Recommending Counselor will then write a report with recommendations about how you should share your child(ren).</p>\r\n          \r\n<br>\t\t  <h3>WHAT DO CHILD CUSTODY RECOMMENDING COUNSELORS DO?</h3>\r\n            <p>The Recommending Counselor meets with and listens to both parents, asks questions to gain additional information about the family, then works with you to come up with a plan you can both agree is best for your child(ren). The Recommending Counselor\u2019s job is to be impartial, keep things fair, help look at different options, help you come up with a calendar for times with your child(ren), and support you in your efforts.

These are important decisions. Sometimes they are the most difficult. California law states that when parents cannot reach an agreement, they must first meet with a professional mediator (Child Custody Recommending Counselor)  before they can go to court. <br><br><a href=\"../divisions/ccrc.html\"><strong><u>Child Custody Recommending Counseling Information</u></strong></a>\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n     <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n         </div>\r\n         \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n     <!-- Start New Module -->\r\n            <div class=\"simpleModuleBlue3\">\r\n                <h3 class=\"bgWhite\">CASE TYPES</h3><br>\r\n                \r\n                 <p><strong>PLEASE  NOTE:</strong> For dissolution of marriage or legal  separation in California, there are only two legal grounds. The first is  \"irreconcilable differences\", meaning that at least one party asserts  that the marriage cannot be saved. The other reason is \"incurable  insanity\" which, unlike irreconcilable differences, must be proven. <br>\r\n                   <br>\r\n                   <strong>Dissolution of Marriage  (Divorce): </strong>A dissolution of marriage, which is more commonly  known as divorce, terminates the marriage and resolves marital issues including  child custody, visitation, child support, spousal support, asset and debt  division (real and personal property), former name restoration, restraining  orders, and other issues identified by the parties. You must wait 6 months from the date the respondent was served with the divorce documents. You will then have to submit judgment paperwork to the court for a Judge\u2019s signature before you are legally divorced. The Family Law Facilitator can help you with this (<a href=\"../selfhelp/workshops-clinics.html\">click here for Self-Help Workshops/Clinics</a>).

The criteria for a summary dissolution  include: </p>\r\n                 <ul class=\"square2\">\r\n                   <li>You were married for under five years, </li>\r\n                   <li>There were no children born during the marriage, </li>\r\n                   <li>You have very few community assets and debts. </li>\r\n                 </ul>\r\n                 <p><strong>Legal Separation:</strong> Legal separation is similar to dissolution of marriage, except  that the parties remain married to each other. The court may make orders  regarding the same issues identified in a dissolution of marriage. <br>\r\n                   <br>\r\n                   If you open a legal separation action, you may amend your petition prior to  judgment to request a dissolution of marriage. That will allow you to  \"start the clock\" on the waiting period for divorce (six months from  date of service), provided that you follow some special instructions. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  <strong>Nullity:</strong> A nullity is more commonly known as an annulment of marriage.

of the trial court\u2019s decision by another court.\u00a0 A party may appeal an unfavorable judgment and certain orders.\u00a0 Generally, the appeal must be based on an argument that a legal error was made by the trial court.</p>\r\n                          <p>You should consult with an attorney as soon as possible before you file an appeal because the law imposes strict timelines for filing an appeal.\u00a0 In some instances, you may qualify for a Court appointed attorney to handle your appeal.</p>\r\n                          <p>An appeal is not a retrial.\u00a0 You will not be permitted to introduce new evidence, and the appellate court will not reassess conflicting evidence.</p>\r\n                          <p>You may not appeal on behalf of a friend, a spouse, a child, or other relative (unless you are a legally appointed guardian).</p>\r\n                          <p>The party filing the appeal is called the appellant.\u00a0 The opposing parties are the

       \r\n                      <p>The first step in the appeal process is filing the written Notice of Appeal.\u00a0 This notice tells the other parties in the case and the court that you are

Before the court can exercise jurisdiction over the person (have the power to order the defendant to do something), the defendant must be aware of the lawsuit and be given an opportunity to defend the claim. The papers must be served on the defendant by personal delivery or certified mail by the court. This is called due process , a fundamental right guaranteed in the Constitution. It means that the government will not take away rights, liberty or property without first notifying the person who is to lose those rights, and giving him or her the right to appear and object. The rules governing notice to a defendant require strict compliance. How do I serve the other party? The correct way to notify a defendant about a lawsuit is by service of process. This means that a copy of the complaint filed in the court must be given to the defendant by one of the following means: Personal service. You may ask anyone who is not a party in your case and who is at least 18 years old to serve (give) a copy of the court papers on the defendant. Personal services means the person personally gave a copy of the court papers to the defendant. Substituted service. Substituted service occurs when a person other than the defendant is served on the defendant\u2019s behalf so long as the papers are served (i) at the defendant\u2019s business with the person in charge; or (ii) at the defendant\u2019s home with a competent person who is at least 18 years old. The person who receives the court papers must be told about their contents. Another copy of the same court papers must be mailed, first class, postage prepaid, to the defendant at the address where the paper was left. The service is not complete until 10 days after the copy is mailed. Certified mail. For small claims cases only , you may ask the Clerk of the Court to serve the defendant by certified mail. The clerk will charge a fee of $15.00 for this service. You should check back with the court prior to the hearing to see if the receipt for certified mail was returned to the court. Service by certified mail can only be accomplished by the Clerk of the Court. The person who completes service as stated above must complete the Proof of Service form, Judicial Council Form SC-104, and have it filed with the Court. PROOF OF SERVICE MUST BE FILED WITH THE COURT FIVE (5) DAYS PRIOR TO THE HEARING DATE. If there is no proof of service on file the matter may be continued or will be automatically dropped from the Court\u2019s calendar. The Plaintiff must then request the matter be reset. YOU CANNOT SERVE PAPERS ON THE DEFENDANT YOURSELF. YOU MUST USE A NON-PARTY. Professional process servers are available for hire, and the sheriff\u2019s department may also serve legal papers for a fee. The defendant must be served at least 15 days before the trial date if he or she lives in the county, and at least 20 days if the defendant lives outside the county. If service is not completed in time, the trial will be continued (postponed). If service is accomplished by substituted service or by certified mail, you must allow 10 ten additional days. How do I prepare my case? You may prepare your own case, or consult with an attorney about the applicable law and preparation for trial. You may also receive assistance from the small claims advisor 1-800-815-2947. If you prepare the case yourself, you may wish to research the legal theory by which you are seeking relief from the court. There are books available in the El Dorado County Law Library at 550 Main Street in Placerville, which explain different legal theories and the elements necessary to prove your case. Small claims court is informal, so you do not have to know the law; however it will improve your chances for success if you can distill the essential elements of the case and present them to the court in a clear and concise manner. The opposing side is entitled to see all evidence before it is submitted to the court; therefore, if you plan to bring documents to show the court, you need to make extra copies for the other side, and for the judge. It will save time if you can each have a copy to refer to in court. Be sure you are on time for the trial. Although the small claims trial is informal, you must be prepared with witnesses, books, receipts and other documents needed to prove your case. If your witnesses are not willing to come to court voluntarily, you can request that the court clerk issue a subpoena . A subpoena is a court order that requires the witness to appear. The witness has a right to charge a fee for appearing. If you do not have in your possession the records or papers necessary to prove your case, you may request the court clerk issue a subpoena duces tecum in advance of the trial date, which orders the documents you are requesting be delivered to court for trial. Many cases are scheduled for the same time, so each case is given limited time. You should describe the events clearly and concisely. Before you present to the court any photographs, diagrams or documents, you must first show them to the opposing side. If possible, observe other small claims proceedings in the same department or courtroom where your case is scheduled, prior to the day you are to appear. You will get an idea how to proceed in an organized manner due to the limited time available for each case. What if I need an interpreter? You may ask a friend, relative, or someone else to interpret for you when you go to court. Please do not ask a child (minor, under the age of 18) to interpret for you. A Court interpreter needs to be familiar with legal terms and concepts in both English and your first language. If you decide to use a friend or relative, have the person read the instructions and duties for interpreting called Foreign Language Interpreter\u2019s Duties-Civil and Small Claims . To find an interpreter that speaks your language visit https://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-interpreter.htm What important rules to know? You must present your case to the Judge. You may not bring your attorney, paralegal or other legal advisor to the hearing. You must not interrupt any party that is speaking. Each witness is given time to speak. Locate your counterpart and exchange all documents. If you only have one set, they are entitled to see it before court. No talking in the courtroom once the room is called to order. No children are allowed in the courtroom. The Court has a dress code and it is enforced. Dress as you would for a job interview in professional business attire. Review the Local Rules of Court for Small Claims prior to your hearings. Local Rules are available on the Court\u2019s web site or are available at the clerk's office for a fee.

The Court and its staff shall employ all necessary and appropriate means to ensure that citizens fulfill this important and civic duty.\u201d  Postponing jury service is preferred to excusing a prospective juror.  Inconvenience to a prospective juror or employer is not an adequate reason to be excused from jury duty.

NOTE: If the juror is under 70 years old, he/she must obtain a statement from a doctor that clearly states that the juror cannot serve jury duty for medical reasons.  Doctor\u2019s note must indicate the expected length of infirmity, or if permanent, must state so.</li>\r\n<li>The prospective juror has served on a grand or trial jury within the preceding 12 months.</li>\r\n<li>The prospective juror is serving on active military duty</li>\r\n<li>The prospective juror would suffer an extreme financial burden.  In determining whether to excuse the prospective juror consideration will be given to the following:\r\n<ul class=\"square2\">\r\n<li>The sources of the prospective juror\u2019s household income;</li>\r\n<li>The availability and extent of income reimbursement,</li>\r\n<li>The expected length of service, and</li>\r\n<li>Whether service can reasonably be expected to compromise that person\u2019s ability to support himself or herself or his or her dependents, or so disrupt the economic stability of any individual as to be against the interests of justice.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n</ul></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nIf you believe you have an undue hardship and need to be excused from jury service, you must submit a request to be excused no later than <strong>NOON</strong> on Wednesday the week <strong>PRIOR</strong> to your appearance.
