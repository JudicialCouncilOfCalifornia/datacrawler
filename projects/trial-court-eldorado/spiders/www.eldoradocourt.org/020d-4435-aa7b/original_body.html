                    	<p>California Rule of Court, Rule 2.1008, specifies the grounds on which the Jury Coordinator’s Office is allowed to excuse jurors from jury service.  It states, “Jury service, unless excused by law, is a responsibility of citizenship.  The Court and its staff shall employ all necessary and appropriate means to ensure that citizens fulfill this important and civic duty.”  Postponing jury service is preferred to excusing a prospective juror.  Inconvenience to a prospective juror or employer is not an adequate reason to be excused from jury duty.  Requests to be excused must be made in writing and supported with facts and/or appropriate documentation as outline below:
                        
          <ul class="square2">              
<li>The prospective juror has no reasonably available means of public or private transportation.</li>
<li>The prospective juror has a personal obligation to provide actual and necessary care to another.  Substitute care is not available or practical without imposing undue economic hardship on the prospective juror or person being cared for.</li> 
<li>The prospective juror has a serious physical or mental condition and jury service would expose him/her to undue risk or physical or mental harm.  NOTE: If the juror is under 70 years old, he/she must obtain a statement from a doctor that clearly states that the juror cannot serve jury duty for medical reasons.  Doctor’s note must indicate the expected length of infirmity, or if permanent, must state so.</li>
<li>The prospective juror has served on a grand or trial jury within the preceding 12 months.</li>
<li>The prospective juror is serving on active military duty</li>
<li>The prospective juror would suffer an extreme financial burden.  In determining whether to excuse the prospective juror consideration will be given to the following:
<ul  class="square2">
<li>The sources of the prospective juror’s household income;</li>
<li>The availability and extent of income reimbursement,</li>
<li>The expected length of service, and</li>
<li>Whether service can reasonably be expected to compromise that person’s ability to support himself or herself or his or her dependents, or so disrupt the economic stability of any individual as to be against the interests of justice.</li>


</ul></li>
</ul>

If you believe you have an undue hardship and need to be excused from jury service, you must submit a request to be excused no later than <strong>NOON</strong> on Wednesday the week <strong>PRIOR</strong> to your appearance.

As a trial juror, you will become an officer of the Court.  You will be performing an important and vital role in the efficient and fair administration of justice.  That may mean rearranging schedules, cancelling appointments, and missing work.  The Jury Commissioner's Office will be as flexible as possible when re-scheduling jurors for jury service.
<br /><br />
If your summoned date is not convenient, you may request ONE (1) postponement for a period of up to 90 days.  (Students and teachers may be rescheduled to the next school break.  Breastfeeding mothers may be postponed for a period of up to one (1) year.)

The El Dorado Superior Court operates on a One Day/One Trial system.  Jurors are instructed to call a recorded telephone message, or use the Automated Jury Program the court day before the date you are scheduled to appear, after 5:00p.m., for reporting instructions.
<br /><br />
Once instructed to report to a courthouse, a juror may or may not be selected to serve as a juror in a trial court.  The Jury Coordinator is required to have a sufficient number of jurors for all anticipated trials.  The jury staff tries to carefully estimate the number of jurors needed but there are many variables outside their control, for example, a case may settle at the last moment.  
<br /><br />
If a prospective juror is selected to serve on a trial as a sworn juror, the term of service will be the length of that trial.  Trials vary in length, but generally last one to three days.

                    	<p>Please be advised that ALL citizens are required by law to serve as jurors periodically unless there is legal cause for excuse or disqualification. The Court is obligated by law to enforce this obligation. </p>    
<p>If you have received a lavender postcard in the mail you are required to reschedule a new service date to satisfy this obligation. Please reschedule a new appearance date as soon as possible or further action will be taken. You may also contact the Jury Coordinator at the West Slope at (530) 621-7469, or South Lake Tahoe at (530) 573-3078 to arrange for a new service date.</p>
<p>If you have received an Order to Show Cause in the mail, you have failed to appear for jury service and also failed to respond to our postcard. This document begins court proceedings against you for failing to participate in serving. Your appearance is mandatory at the hearing as stated in this document. You may not reschedule your service at this point, you must appear before the Judge at this hearing. The Court and its staff shall employ all necessary and appropriate means to ensure that all eligible citizens fulfill this important civic duty.</p>
<p>If you have been served personally an Order to Show Cause for Contempt by the Sheriff, you have failed to respond to all Court communication up to this point. If you do not appear as required it could result in a warrant being issued for your arrest. There is also a potential fine of $2000.00 if you fail to appear at this hearing.</p>

You will need to make other arrangements for your child’s care while you are at the court for jury duty.  Not appearing for jury duty because you cannot find appropriate childcare is NOT an excused absence.</p>
