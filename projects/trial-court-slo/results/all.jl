This procedure is known as a \u201c<strong>Counter&nbsp;</strong><strong>Arraignment</strong>\u201d and is designed to save time and effort of sitting through a court session. This option is&nbsp;also available for payment of Traffic School fees.</p>\n\n<p>A defendant who enters a guilty plea in writing at the clerk\u2019s office will be given the options to request a one-time 90 day extension for a $30 time extension fee or they may request monthly payments of $50/$100 per month for a $35 payment plan fee. This option is also available for Traffic School fees.</p>\n\n<p>Fine can be satisfied by completing community work service or some combination of work and fine. There is a required minimum payment due when the Counter Arraignment is signed.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<strong>Proof of Correction</strong>\n\n<p>How to obtain Proof of Correction for Mechanical, Registration, License and Insurance Violations (\u201cfix-it tickets\u201d):</p>\n\n<p>The citing officer must allege on the citation that the violation is correctable. Violations marked with an asterisk on your courtesy bail notice designate correctable violations.</p>\n\n<p><em>Advisement:</em><em> Fraudulent or altered documentation may be referred to the Office of the District Attorney for a full investigation and possible criminal prosecution. </em></p>\n\n<p><em>A photo copy of the signed off citation is not acceptable; unless, the submitted citation is a copy with an original signature of Law Enforcement or DMV. </em></p>\n\n<strong>Mechanical Violations</strong>\n\n<p>Proof of correction violations (required under VC40610) will be dismissed once the following have occurred (if taken care of in a timely manner).</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>The item is corrected (e.g. the tail light is fixed).</li>\n\t<li>An authorized representative signs the citation or Courtesy Bail Notice certifying it was corrected.</li>\n\t<li>The signed citation is submitted with a mandatory Fix-it Fee to the court.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Authorized representatives include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>All California Law Enforcement agencies</li>\n\t<li>Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)<br/>\n\t(for license and registration issues)</li>\n\t<li>Any Station in California licensed to inspect and certify for the violation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Many agencies charge a fee to sign the cite; this is different than the&nbsp;State Administration&nbsp;Fix-it Fee&nbsp;required by the court.</p>\n\n<p>If you are delinquent in appearing, proof of correction will probably not reduce the bail or fine.</p>\n\n<strong>Registration and License Violations</strong>\n\n<p>If you are charged with a violation of the registration law, you must show proof to the Court that the vehicle has been registered, junked, or receipted as planned non-operation <strong>after</strong> the date of citation. A&nbsp;$25 State Mandated Fix-it fee will also be due.&nbsp;If&nbsp;proof of Release of Liability is submitted and it&nbsp;is dated with DMV <strong>prior </strong>to the violation date the $25&nbsp;Fix-it Fee is waived.</p>\n\n<p>You may have DMV \"Sign-Off\" the violation on the back of your citation or you may submit a copy of your registration, proof of your junked or dismantled vehicle or proof the vehicle has been placed in non-operational status \"Non-Op'd\".</p>\n\n<p>If you are charged with a license violation you may have the DMV sign off the back of your citation or sign your Courtesy Bail Notice.

You will walk through a metal detector and your handbags, briefcases, backpacks and containers may be X-rayed. Weapons of any type will not be permitted into any court facility. Items such as: knives (including pocket knives), guns, stun guns, pepper spray, mace, scissors, knitting needles, corkscrews, or any item that may be used as a weapon are not permitted. All weapons are prohibited and it is a felony to bring them into court buildings. <strong>Please allow extra time</strong> for this screening process.</p>\n\n<p>Often students, teachers, physicians and small business owners and others with unusual schedules think that they are exempt from serving on jury duty. We cannot exempt or excuse you; however you are eligible for a onetime postponement for up to 6 months.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<strong>Rescheduling Jury Service</strong>\n\n<p><strong>Excuse or postponement request <em>must</em> be received by Jury Services prior to your summons date.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jury service may be postponed one time for up to 6 months. There are no permanent excuses to jury service except verified medical illness. If approved for postponement you will receive a new summons for that date or the closest one available approximately 4&nbsp;weeks before your new appearance date.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<strong>Payment for Service</strong>\n\n<p>Pursuant to section 230a of the Labor Code, your employer cannot prevent you from serving as a juror and is not required to pay you while on jury duty.

Mediation is a process of assisting parents in developing a parenting plan and is a neutral setting for discussing arrangements for the children, and to reduce acrimony and provide guidelines for parenting after separation or divorce. Mediation is a means of settling parenting disputes outside of court. Each parent is given the opportunity to be heard, and the objective is to develop parenting plans that meet the needs of the child/ren. Mediation is confidential from the Court process, and the mediator does not make recommendations to the Court if the parents are in disagreement. If an agreement is reached, the stipulation/agreement is submitted to the Court only after the parties have agreed in writing.</p>\n\n<p>For more information regarding the procedures for scheduling a mediation appointment, contact Family Court Services between the hours of 8:30 am and 4 pm on Monday through Thursday at (805) 706-3608.</p>\n\n<strong>Mediation by Phone</strong>\n\n<p>Family Court Services can accommodate requests for long distance and out of state telephone mediation for parents who reside outside San Luis Obispo County. All telephone mediations must be approved by&nbsp;FCS prior to the scheduled appointment.&nbsp;<strong>For telephonic mediations a <em>Mediation Intake Form </em>(see below) must be received by the parent pre-approved to call in&nbsp;at least 24 hours prior to the appointment time.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The intake form can be faxed to 805-706-0210 or mailed to the FCS address:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Family Court Services</strong><br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 901 Park Street<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paso Robles, CA, 93446</p>\n\n<strong>Mediation is for parents only</strong>\n\n<p>New spouses, significant other relationships and extended family members are not to be included unless previously approved by Family Court Services. Children are not included unless previously arranged by Family Court Services. Please contact FCS prior to your appointment if you wish to have a support person present because of domestic violence or if you have any questions about who is to attend mediation in your particular matter. <strong>Please do not bring your children to mediation. </strong></p>\n\n<strong>Mediation Documents</strong>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Mediation Intake Form</li>\n\t<li>Mediation Orientation</li>\n\t<li>Mediation Exit Survey</li>\n\t<li>Domestic Violence and Child Custody</li>\n</ol>\n\n<strong>Domestic Violence and Restraining Orders</strong>\n\n<p>In cases involving domestic violence, mediation is conducted in a manner to protect all the parties. Family Court Services' policy is to meet with each party separately. FCS schedules each appointment at separate times. FCS's goal is to protect all parties during the mediation experience in order to create the best possible environment to help families develop parenting plans with as little conflict as possible and with the highest level of satisfaction possible.</p>\n\n<strong>Child Custody Evaluations</strong>\n\n<p>NINOS: EL DESAFIO DEL DIVORCIO</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>REGISTRO:&nbsp; </strong>Llame a la oficina de antemano a los Servicios de la Corte de Relaciones Familiares para registrarse y obtener informacion, al numero 805-226-3251.&nbsp; Debe tener disponible el numero del caso civil o del divorcio para darselo al secretario.&nbsp; Clases en espanol son ofrecidas, y son citadas de acuerdo con los registrados.</p>\n\n<p><strong>COSTO:</strong>&nbsp; gratis</p>\n\n<p>Este programa satisface los requisitos del programa de educacion antes de que se le otorga las ordenes judiciales para finalizar el caso.</p>\n\n\n<p>In cases with ongoing unresolved disputes between parents, the Court&nbsp;may order a&nbsp;child custody evaluation. The evaluation is conducted by a court appointed evaluator. The focus of a child custody evaluation is to assess the individual and family factors that affect the best interests of the child/ren. The primary purpose and function of a child custody evaluation is to gather information about the family in a comprehensive and unbiased manner, and to report back to the court with a recommendation for a parenting plan that will help the child/ren maintain relationships with both parents&nbsp;in a manner that&nbsp;best serves his/her needs.</p>\n\n<p>To accomplish this end, a child custody evaluation usually includes (1) an assessment of each parent's historical involvement and current capacities for parenting and their ability to manage conflict; (2) an assessment of the child's functioning and developmental needs and the child's wishes where appropriate; and (3) an assessment of each parent's functional ability to meet the child's needs, which includes evaluation of the interaction between each adult and child.</p>\n\n<p>Some evaluations are much more limited in scope than others. This will be described in the evaluation order. Your evaluator will review the process for your family during your first appointment with them.</p>\n\n<p>If a custody evaluation is ordered by the court for your family, please be sure to read through the order carefully.&nbsp; We need your help to get things started, and the order will give you directions on how to proceed.&nbsp; Contact Family Court Services with any questions at 805-706-3608.</p>\n\n<p>With an ordered custody evaluation only,&nbsp;we require that each parent fill out the following forms and deliver them to Family Court Services:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Family Court Services Intake Form&nbsp;(AKA: Custody evaluation personal data sheet)</li>\n\t<li>Release of Information\n\t\u200b<strong>NOTE:</strong> For full evaluations, please complete a release of information form for each treatment professional who is working with or has recently worked with you and your children (IE: schools, therapists, pediatricians).

An appeal is not a retrial or rehearing and new evidence cannot be introduced. The reviewing court can only determine if the lower court erred in rendering its decision.</p>\n\n<p>Small Claims appeals are the exception. These appeals are scheduled for a new trial.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<strong>Who Can File an Appeal?</strong>\n\n<p>In a Small Claims case, the defendant may file an appeal or the plaintiff may file an appeal on a defendant's claim.</p>\n\n<p>In a limited or unlimited civil case, including domestic, probate and mental health, any party may file an appeal.</p>\n\n<p>In an infractions, misdemeanor or felony case, the defendant may file an appeal. In certain circumstances, the People of the State of California may file an appeal.</p>\n\n<p>A death penalty conviction is appealed automatically.</p>\n\n<p>In a juvenile dependency or delinquency case, any party may file an appeal.</p>\n\n<p>A party may represent him/her self (pro per) or select to be represented by an attorney. The party filing an appeal is called the Appellant. The party against whom an appeal is filed is called the Respondent.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<strong>When to File an Appeal?</strong>\n\n<p>Small Claims and Limited Civil appeals are filed within 30 days from the date of mailing of the Notice of Entry of Judgment.</p>\n\n<p>Unlimited Civil appeals are filed within 60 days from the date of mailing of the Notice of Entry of<br/>\nJudgment or if the notice is not mailed, 180 days from the date of entry of judgment.</p>\n\n<p>Infractions and Misdemeanor appeals are filed within 30 days after the order or judgment.</p>\n\n<p>Felony appeals are filed within 60 days from judgment.</p>\n\n<p>Juvenile appeals are filed within 60 days after an appealable order or 60 days after the order becomes final under CRC 1417(c).</p>\n\n<p>All days are calendar days unless otherwise specified as court days.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<strong>What is the Filing Fee?</strong>\n\n<p>No filing fee is charged for infraction, misdemeanor or juvenile appeals. Check the current Schedule of Fees for other appeals fees.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<strong>How to Appeal</strong>\n\n<p>Notify the court in writing by filing a Notice of Appeal.

Your declaration must explain all the reasons the court should grant the orders you are requesting.</p>\n\n<p>It is your job to give the judge facts, details, dates, description of events, etc. so the judge can reach the conclusion that is most favorable to you. In your declaration, you must answer the question about why the judge should grant the orders you are requesting. On the day of the hearing, you may forget to tell the judge your whole story. So, all the facts and details you want the judge to consider should be stated in your declaration.</p>\n\n<p>Your declaration may be up to 10 pages long,&nbsp;doubled spaced using 12 point font. When writing or typing your declaration, keep in mind the judge will have to read this and refer to it at your hearing. Use descriptive headings for your paragraphs. This should tell the judge what the paragraph is about. You should start with the most important issue and the most recent event. When the judge is finished reading your declaration there should be no doubt about what you want, why you want it and why the judge should do what you want.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<strong>Attaching Documents (Exhibits)</strong>\n\n<p>Exhibits are documents that support something you are saying in your declaration. If you believe there are documents the judge should read, you may attach them to your declaration. You must properly describe the document in your declaration by stating what the document is, what exhibit number you have assigned it and why the document is important for the judge to consider, e.g. \u201cAttached as Exhibit 1 is a true and correct copy of my paystubs for the last 3 months showing my gross monthly income is $1550.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<strong>Forms Needed</strong>\n\n<p>The following are the basic forms you need to file a request for a hearing.</p>\n\n<p>Click on each form to complete, save and print:</p>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Request for Order (FL-300)</li>\n\t<li>Attachment to Judicial Council Form (MC-025)</li>\n\t<li>Statement of Venue (SLO form FL013)&nbsp;(only if not previously filed)</li>\n\t<li>Proof of Personal Service (FL-330)</li>\n\t<li>Blank Responsive Declaration (FL-320)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<strong>If you are requesting child custody/visitation orders you may also need:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Child Custody and Visitation Application Attachment (FL-311)</li>\n\t<li>Request for Child Abduction Prevention Orders (FL-312)</li>\n\t<li>Children's Holiday Schedule Attachment (FL-341(C))</li>\n\t<li>Joint Legal Custody Provisions (FL-341(E))</li>\n</ul>\n\n<strong>If you are requesting child support or spousal support or attorney fees orders you will also need:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Income and Expense Declaration (FL-150)</li>\n\t<li>Declaration Regarding SLO Policies and Procedures &sect;2:8</li>\n</ul>\n\n<strong>If you are requesting emergency Ex-Parte Orders you will also need:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Temporary Orders (FL-305)</li>\n\t<li>Declaration of Notice on Emergency Application for Orders (FL010)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>You may also obtain the forms listed above at the following places:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Internet</strong>:&nbsp;For free, you can log onto www.courts.ca.gov and hover over&nbsp;\u201cForms &amp;

One or both parents can have legal custody.&nbsp; If both parents are making decisions about the child it is called joint legal custody.&nbsp; When writing your declaration you need to explain why it is in the child\u2019s best interest for one or both parents to make these decisions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Physical Custody</strong>: Physical custody deals with the days and times that the child will spend with each parent.&nbsp; If the child primarily lives with one parent it is called physical custody.&nbsp; If you are requesting that both parents spend a substantial period of time with the child, it is called Joint Physical Custody.&nbsp; When writing your declaration you need to explain why your proposed physical custody request is in the child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Visitation</strong>: Visitation is the time&nbsp;the child spends with the parent who does not primarily live with the child.&nbsp; When writing your declaration you need to explain why your proposed visitation schedule is in the child\u2019s best interest.&nbsp; There are several options to choose from when it comes to visitation, generally they are: (1) Reasonable Visitation (2) Specific Visitation Schedule (3) Supervised Visitation.&nbsp; <em>Reasonable visitation</em> does not define the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child.&nbsp; A reasonable visitation court order usually works when both parents are in agreement about the time share that each is to have with the child.&nbsp; A <em>specific visitation schedule</em> defines the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child.&nbsp; A specific visitation schedule may be necessary for parents who have a difficult time agreeing on the days and times that each parent will spend with the child.&nbsp; <em>Supervised Visitation</em> requires that a responsible adult be present during any visitation times with the child.&nbsp; A supervised visitation order may be necessary if there are reasonable concerns that a parent may harm the child if left alone.&nbsp; You may request a non-professional or professional supervisor.&nbsp; Click here for more&nbsp;information on Supervised Visitation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Prevent Child Abduction</strong>:&nbsp; If there are facts that show that the other parent may be thinking of taking the child and hiding the child from you, then you may request orders to prevent the other parent from abducting the child.&nbsp; When writing your declaration you need to explain what the other party has done or plans to do to take and hide the child from you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Child Support</strong>:&nbsp; Both parents are required to financially support the minor child.&nbsp; Child support is the amount of money that one parent pays to the other to equalize the financial responsibility.&nbsp; The amount of child support is arrived by inputting several numbers into a formula.&nbsp; The main factors that are taken into consideration are: (1) Dad\u2019s gross monthly income (2) Mom\u2019s gross monthly income and (3) Percentage of time that is spent with the child.&nbsp; When writing your declaration, you must address each of these factors.&nbsp; The judge needs to know what you are claiming each of these numbers is and also how you arrived at those numbers.&nbsp; Other facts that may be discussed in your declaration are: (1) the other parent\u2019s ability to earn income, (2) the number of other biological children living with you (3) the amount of child care costs per month (4) the amount of rental income received (5) the amount of property taxes and mortgage interest paid per month and (6) the amount paid per month for health insurance premiums.&nbsp; You may attach any supporting documentation to your declaration as exhibits.&nbsp; Be prepared for what the amount of child support might be.&nbsp; Before you file your OSC, the Self-Help Center / Family Law Facilitator may help you calculate the amount of child support or you may go to https://www.cse.ca.gov/ChildSupport/cse/guidelineCalculator to calculate the child support amount on your own.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spousal Support</strong>:&nbsp; (formerly known as \u201cALIMONY\u201d):&nbsp; The judge has discretion to order the payment of spousal support.&nbsp; The judge will consider several factors before deciding whether to award spousal support, the amount of spousal support and the length of time that spousal support will be received.&nbsp; Some of the factors the judge will consider are:&nbsp; (1) Spouse\u2019s ability to pay spousal support (2) Other spouse\u2019s need to receive spousal support and (3) Standard of living during your marriage.&nbsp;

A contested trial will be scheduled within 45 days. You may waive your right to a speedy trial and have it scheduled within a reasonable amount of time.</p>\n\n<p>While many individuals with a good record may be released on their promise to appear, the court may require bail to be posted to secure appearance at trial, particularly <strong>if you have previous failures to appear or pay.</strong></p>\n\n<p>At your trial, the officer who issued the citation will testify as a witness. If there are other witnesses, they may also be called to testify.</p>\n\n<p>At the trial you may question (cross-examine) the witnesses. You may testify yourself and / or call witnesses to testify.</p>\n\n<p>After the evidence is presented the judge may rule immediately whether you are guilty or not guilty or the case may be taken under submission before deciding. If the case is taken under submission, you will be notified of the ruling by mail or you may choose to return to court.</p>\n\n<p>If you are found not guilty, that is the end of the case. If you are found guilty, the judge will determine how much the fine will be. <strong>The fine may be more or less than the bail originally quoted in your case </strong>depending on the facts which were presented. If your driving record shows previous convictions, the fine may increase substantially and your driver's license may be suspended for up to 6 months.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<strong>Trials</strong>\n\n<p><strong>Trial by Written Declaration</strong> \u2013 This option is for infraction violations only and does not require a personal appearance. You may request a Trial by Written Declaration which requires you to post bail in lieu of your appearance.</p>\n\n<p>Instructions and forms for a Trial by Written Declaration may be obtained on our forms page, by mail, or in person. Submit the Trial by Written Declaration form with any facts or evidence you wish to have considered. A written statement will be requested from the citing officer(s). A judicial officer will review your case and you will be notified by mail of the decision</p>\n\n<p><strong>Court Trial</strong> \u2013 This option requires a court appearance and is available for all violations.</p>\n\n<p>A Court Trial requires you to post bail if you do not appear for arraignment. Posting bail pursuant to VC40519(b) constitutes a waiver of your right to a speedy trial within 45 days. Send a check or money order for the total bail or appear for an arraignment and enter your plea after which the court will set your trial date and notice you by mail. If you fail to appear at the time designated for your trial, either a trial in your absence will occur (Trial in Absentia), or a VC40508(a) misdemeanor charge may be added against you, which bears a $300.00 assessment and a driver\u2019s license suspension until resolved.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, see Pleading Not Guilty, above.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<strong> What is a Subpoena?</strong>\n\n<p>A Subpoena is actually an order from the Court telling a person to either show up in court, or to bring something to court. When a Subpoena is directed to a person to appear in court, it is called a personal subpoena. When it is used to get a thing into court (like a photograph or sign), it is called a \u201cSubpoena Duces Tecum\u201d \u2013 which means, basically, Subpoena \u201cbring with you\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>In CA there is a mandatory form for Criminal and Traffic Court subpoenas that is published by the Judicial Council Subpoena Form CR-125.</p>\n\n<strong>What Sort of Things Does a Subpoena Work For?</strong>\n\n<p>A Traffic Court Defendant in California can use a Subpoena to require any witness to appear in court. This includes police, bystanders who saw what happened, passengers, the person who maintains the machine, or the tow truck driver who impounded the car.</p>\n\n<p>A Subpoena can also be used to get things into trial such as photos, maintenance records, radar guns, video recordings, paperwork, etc.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to force a thing to come to court, you have to direct the subpoena to the \u201cCustodian of Records\u201d \u2013 or the person who is known to have possession or control over the item. Most large businesses and government agencies (including the CHP) have a person designated as the \u201cCustodian of Records\u201d who is responsible for responding to subpoenas.</p>\n\n<strong>How Does a Defendant Representing Themselves Get a Subpoena Issued?</strong>\n\n<p>In cases where a defendant represents themselves, (called \u201cpro per\u201d), the Defendant has the right to use a Subpoena, but they must get the court clerk to sign the completed Subpoena Form.</p>\n\n<p>You can download the Judicial Council Subpoena Form CR-125. Then fill in as much information as possible and take it in person to the clerk\u2019s office for issuance.

ADR programs provide alternative ways to resolve your dispute. Generally, these include using a neutral third party to help you find a resolution. While the court may be considered the original \u201cneutral third party\u201d, most people find litigation (court procedures) to be time consuming, stressful, and expensive. ADR programs are here to offer you an option that can bring closure more efficiently and in some ways, more effectively.\n\n<p>San Luis Obispo County Superior Court ADR programs include Mediation and Arbitration. View&nbsp;a list of the mediators that can be found in the Mediation Binders located in all civil courtrooms.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<strong>Mediation</strong>\n\n<p>Mediation is fair, voluntary, confidential, and flexible. Choosing mediation allows you to try and resolve the situation based on what\u2019s most important to you.The mediator facilitates a productive process to help break down the barriers in communication that often go up due to conflict, and to explore options allowing parties to arrive at a mutual, acceptable resolution.The mediator does not decide the dispute; the parties retain power over the outcome.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<strong>Arbitration</strong>\n\n<p>Arbitration is normally an informal process in which a neutral person (the arbitrator) decides the dispute after hearing the evidence and arguments of the parties.The parties can agree to binding or non-binding arbitration.Binding arbitration is designed to give each side a resolution of their dispute when they cannot agree between themselves or with a mediator. If the arbitration is non-binding, any party can reject the arbitrator\u2019s decision and request a trial. Generally arbitration must be ordered by the court. In San Luis Obispo Superior Court if there is an order for non-binding arbitration, arrangements are made through Jury Services.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more on how to resolve disputes from the State Bar of California<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<strong>What are the potential advantages of ADR?</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>ADR can <strong>save time and money</strong>. ADR, especially when used early in a dispute, can save a lot of time and money. Even when ADR does not result in an immediate resolution, it can produce savings by clarifying and narrowing the scope of the dispute.</li>\n\t<li>ADR provides <strong>increased flexibility and control</strong>. ADR typically gives you greater flexibility and control in the dispute resolution process - in the procedures followed, the interests considered and the remedies adopted - than you would have in a court trial. In mediation, for example, you can work out a resolution that may not be available in court.</li>\n\t<li>ADR is generally <strong>confidential</strong>. Confidentiality encourages openness and candor, and is considered an important factor in the effectiveness of ADR.</li>\n\t<li>ADR can <strong>improve communication and preserve relationships</strong>. Some ADR processes are designed to reduce the hostility created by the dispute and to help each side communicate with the other. This is particularly true of mediation. The aim of mediation is to create a cooperative atmosphere in which both sides can find \"win-win\" solutions that will preserve or improve, rather than further damage, the relationship.</li>\n\t<li>ADR can give you <strong>a chance to tell your side of the story</strong>. Some ADR processes will permit you to tell your side of the story in a way that cannot be done in court. This opportunity for both sides to be heard can make the difference between a satisfying or frustrating dispute resolution process.</li>\n\t<li>ADR can <strong>reduce stress and increase satisfaction</strong>. Litigation can be highly stressful. Lack of control over the process and outcome, prolonged uncertainty and mounting costs all contribute to such stress. The benefits of many ADR processes - reduced expense, confidentiality, a quicker process, an out-of-court setting and greater control for those involved, for example - often make them less stressful.</li>\n</ul></p>"], "_template": "5a0b-4d51-805f", "parent": ["https://www.slo.courts.ca.gov/dv/civil.htm"], "title": ["Alternative Dispute Resolution"]}

It may be worth more than all of the other assets put together.&nbsp; There are very specific and technical rules that apply to pensions and you should get legal advice from a lawyer in order to protect your interest in the pension.&nbsp; In some cases, a pension plan must be \u201cjoined\u201d as a party in your divorce case before a judge will issue an order about how the pension will be divided. Read the Retirement Plan Joinder - Information Sheet<em> </em>(FL-318-INFO) for more information about whether the pension plan must be joined in your divorce case.&nbsp; The court order that details how a pension will be divided is called a qualified domestic relations order, or QDRO. The QDRO must be approved by both the benefits provider and the judge to assure that the spouse/partner that is not the employee of the company or organization will receive those future benefits. A QDRO is an extremely complicated legal document and if you make a mistake, there can be harmful results.</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            Preliminary &amp; Final Declaration of Disclosure\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>California law requires that you and your spouse give each other written information about all the income, expenses, assets and debts that you know to exist.&nbsp; This act of revealing and making something known to the other person is called \"disclosure.\"&nbsp; Disclosure is required at the beginning of the case (Preliminary) and end of the case (Final).&nbsp; Disclosure is intended to make sure that you and your spouse are aware of everything each of you own and owe.&nbsp; With this information you can divide your&nbsp;assets and debts equally, and can make reasonable decisions about support.

Status of Marriage</strong>\n\n<p>Standard: Irreconcilable differences have arisen.&nbsp; If you were married, then the judge will want to know if \u201cirreconcilable differences have arisen leading to the irremediable breakdown of the marriage.\u201d This means that there has been a breakdown of the marriage and that no amount of counseling will reunite the two of you.&nbsp;<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<strong>2. Child Custody and Visitation</strong>\n\n<p>Standard:&nbsp; Best Interest of Child.&nbsp; If there are minor children of the marriage, then you will want to explain to the judge what you want and why.&nbsp; If you are requesting no or supervised visitation don\u2019t forget to tell the judge why you believe your proposal is in the best interests of the child or children.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<strong>3. Child Support / Health insurance / Child Care</strong>\n\n<p>Main Factors to Determine Child Support:&nbsp; Dad\u2019s Income, Mom\u2019s Income, Percentage of Time each Parent.</p>\n\n<p>If you are going to request a specific amount of child support at your default hearing, you may have the Self-Help Center / Family Law Facilitator calculate the possible guideline child support amount or you may want to calculate it on your own at www.childsup.ca.gov.&nbsp; In order to calculate child support you should bring a copy of your FL-150 Income and Expense Declaration.&nbsp; Also, you will have to make an estimate for the judge as to the other parent\u2019s gross income before taxes.&nbsp; If you tell the judge, \u201cI don\u2019t know what s/he makes,\u201d then the judge will have a difficult time making an order.&nbsp; Remember, you know more about what the other parent earns or is able to earn than the judge does.&nbsp; For this reason, you can describe the other parent\u2019s occupation, experience, etc., and let the judge know what you believe the other parent is capable of earning.&nbsp; The judge can then use this figure in setting the other parent\u2019s earnings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>At your hearing, you may also request an order that the other parent carry the minor children on health insurance available through the other parent\u2019s employment even if they don\u2019t have insurance now.&nbsp; Note that the judge may make the same order for you that each of you carry the children on insurance that is available at no or reasonable cost through your employment.&nbsp; You may also request that each parent pay one-half of any reasonable health care expenses that are not covered by the insurance.</p>\n\n<p>If you incur child care expenses while you are at work or school, you may request that the other parent pay for one-half of any child care expenses incurred while you are at work or school.</p>\n\n<p>If there is a case with the Department of Child Support Services, you will want to let the judge know this. Bring a copy of the child support order with you to your hearing. If the case is in another county, you will want to tell the judge the name of the other county where the DCSS case is located.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<strong>4. Spousal Support</strong>\n\n<p>Main Factors:&nbsp; Ability to Pay; Need for Support; Standard of Living During Marriage; Length of Marriage; Age and health of each spouse; How much income each can earn on their own; What the expenses of each spouse are; Whether there are minor children at home; The history of the way the couple handled money during the marriage; What each person needs; What each person pays or can pay (including earnings and earning capacity); Whether having a job would make it too hard to take care of the minor children; Debts and property; Whether one spouse or domestic partner helped the other get an education, training, career, or professional license; Whether there was domestic violence in the marriage or domestic partnership; Whether one spouse's, or domestic partner's, career was affected by unemployment, or by taking care of the children or home, and; The tax impact of spousal support.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to request a specific amount of spousal support, you will need to tell the judge all the facts in your case that are related to the factors listed above.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not ever want spousal support (now or in the future), then let the judge know you are \u201cwaiving\u201d spousal support.&nbsp; If you waive spousal support, you will never be able to ask for spousal support in the future, even if you need it.&nbsp; If you have a marriage of 10 years or more the court will want you to explain why this is a reasonable request.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not ever want to pay spousal support to the other party, then let the judge know that you want to \u201cterminate jurisdiction\u201d over the issue of spousal support.&nbsp; If you have a marriage of 10 years or more the court will want you to explain why this is a reasonable request.</p>\n\n<p>If you want the court to make spousal support orders in the future, then let the judge know that you want to \u201creserve jurisdiction\u201d over the issue of spousal support.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<strong>5. Assets and Debts</strong>\n\n<p>Standard: Equal Division of Community Property and Debt.&nbsp; Remember that community property is defined as any asset or debt that was purchased or incurred after date of marriage and before date of separation.&nbsp; There are some exceptions to this rule, such as gifts or inheritance.&nbsp; Generally, in a default hearing the court wants to be able to divide that community property assets and debts equally between the parties.</p>\n\n<p>If there are assets or debts to be divided by the judge, you should review the FL-160 Property Declaration(s) that you previously completed.&nbsp; If you are requesting that the community property assets and debts be divided unequally, you will need to tell the judge why your unequal proposal for division is a fair and equitable division.</p>\n\n<p>If you are requesting that the court divide a pension or retirement plan then you may need to seek legal advice from an attorney before you get divorced. In most cases, the pension plan will not be able to disburse any money until a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) is signed by the judge.&nbsp; In addition, if the employee spouse dies before a QDRO is signed then the pension will not pay out any money to the spouse.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<strong>6. Restoring of your Former Name</strong>\n\n<p>If you want the judge to order that your name be restored to your former name, be sure to request this at the time of your hearing.</p></p>"], "_template": "5a0b-4d51-805f", "parent": ["https://www.slo.courts.ca.gov/sh/selfhelp-divorce-defaulthearing.htm"], "title": ["Finish a Divorce Case: Default Hearing Checklist"]}
