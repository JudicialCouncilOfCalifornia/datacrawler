The Court is audited by the state for case types and procedures that affect\u00a0the budget of the court and the allocation of judicial resources. In these tight\u00a0budgetary times, our Court finds it necessary to more strictly enforce the Rules of\u00a0Court regarding case types.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Each judge to whom civil cases are assigned shall \u00a0determine (with or\u00a0without a hearing) whether or not the case should be designated as complex\u00a0pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.403. \u00a0If the matter is designated as\u00a0complex, and if all parties have not yet paid the complex case fee required by\u00a0Government Code \u00a726826.4, the Court shall order payment of that fee.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The Court will make every effort to determine whether a case is complex as\u00a0soon as feasible after a case is filed. The judge \u00a0assigned to the case has the\u00a0continuing power, pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.403(b), to decide\u00a0on its own motion or on noticed motion of any party, that a civil action is a\u00a0complex case or that an action previously declared \u00a0to be a complex case is not a\u00a0complex case.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The Court would appreciate the cooperation and assistance of the lawyers\u00a0appearing before us in properly designating complexcases.<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Use of Court Reporters in Civil Matters</h3>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"date\">November 1, 2011</span></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Use of Court Reporters in Civil\u00a0Law Matters\u00a0Due to inadequate funding caused by budget cutbacks, the\u00a0Court regrets that it will no longer be able to provide court\u00a0reporters in civil law matters.\u00a0If you wish to have a matter reported, please make\u00a0advance arrangements with any licensed reporter or reporting\u00a0firm.

A\u00a0$25 State Mandated Fix-it fee will also be due.\u00a0If\u00a0proof of Release of Liability is submitted and it\u00a0is dated with DMV <strong>prior </strong>to the violation date the $25\u00a0Fix-it Fee is waived.</p>\n\n<p>You may have DMV \"Sign-Off\" the violation on the back of your citation or you may submit a copy of your registration, proof of your junked or dismantled vehicle or proof the vehicle has been placed in non-operational status \"Non-Op'd\".</p>\n\n<p>If you are charged with a license violation you may have the DMV sign off the back of your citation or sign your Courtesy Bail Notice. You may also provide a copy of your driver's license to the court. <strong>Sign-off only qualifies if the violation is filed as an \"infraction\" and the citing officer allows for correction. </strong></p>\n\n<h4>Insurance Violations</h4>\n\n<p>If you were charged with a violation of the proof of financial responsibility law (VC16028), the Court will dismiss the charge only if it is shown that the defendant was financially responsible (i.e. there was an insurance policy that covered the defendant/driver <strong>on the date of violation, or proof\u00a0the the vehicle was insured at the time of the violation)</strong>.

Prospective juror names are obtained from voter registration and DMV records.\u00a0By law, prospective jurors are randomly chosen and because of this, we regret that we cannot accept volunteers for jury duty.</p>\n\n<p>Normally, service may be required as often as once per year. Service lasts from one day to the length of the trial, starting at 8:00am and ending at 5:00pm. <strong>Business attire is suggested. No tank tops, shorts, bare midriffs, or bare feet are permitted in the courtroom.</strong></p>\n\n<p>When entering any court facility all persons are subject to <strong>screening through a security device</strong>. You will walk through a metal detector and your handbags, briefcases, backpacks and containers may be X-rayed. Weapons of any type will not be permitted into any court facility. Items such as: knives (including pocket knives), guns, stun guns, pepper spray, mace, scissors, knitting needles, corkscrews, or any item that may be used as a weapon are not permitted. All weapons are prohibited and it is a felony to bring them into court buildings. <strong>Please allow extra time</strong> for this screening process.</p>\n\n<p>Often students, teachers, physicians and small business owners and others with unusual schedules think that they are exempt from serving on jury duty. We cannot exempt or excuse you; however you are eligible for a onetime postponement for up to 6 months.<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Rescheduling Jury Service</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Excuse or postponement request <em>must</em> be received by Jury Services prior to your summons date.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jury service may be postponed one time for up to 6 months. There are no permanent excuses to jury service except verified medical illness. If approved for postponement you will receive a new summons for that date or the closest one available approximately 4\u00a0weeks before your new appearance date.<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Payment for Service</h3>\n\n<p>Pursuant to section 230a of the Labor Code, your employer cannot prevent you from serving as a juror and is not required to pay you while on jury duty. However, the Superior Court will pay you $15.00 per day starting with your second day of service, plus mileage.<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Directions, Parking, and Public Transportation</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"/index.htm#branch_criminal\">San Luis Obispo Criminal Branch</a><br>\n<a href=\"/index.htm#branch_civil\">San Luis Obispo Civil Branch</a><br>\n<a href=\"/index.htm#branch_vetmemorial\">San Luis Obispo Branch - Veterans Memorial</a><br>\n<a href=\"/index.htm#branch_pasorobles\">Paso Robles Branch</a></p>\n\n<h4>Parking Validation</h4>\n\n<p>Jury Services validates parking <em><strong>only</strong></em> at the parking structure at 842 Palm Street, across from the Palm Theatre.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Take the ticket from the dispenser when entering.</li>\n\t<li>Bring that ticket into Jury Services for validation on each day of appearance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Street Parking</h4>\n\n<p>You may park for free on the street - in a two hour or more space - <em><strong>only</strong></em> if you cannot use the garage because:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>you're in an oversized vehicle,</li>\n\t<li>you rode a motorcycle,</li>\n\t<li>or the parking garage is full.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are the <strong><em>only</em></strong> reasons you will be allowed to park on the street, and only in a two hour or more space. If one of these situations does not apply to you, you may receive a parking ticket.</p>\n\n<p>Place your juror parking card (located on the top of your summons) on your dashboard - the summons date and juror badge number must visible. You do <em>not</em> need to put money in the meter.</p>\n\n<p>The summons date <strong>must</strong> be a current date. If it is not a current date, go into Jury Services and request an updated form for your dash. This updated form must be placed on your dash so you do not receive a parking ticket.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h4>Bus Service Information</h4>\n\n<p>Within San Luis Obispo city limits, call (805) 541-2877.<br>\nOutside city limits, contact <a href=\"http://www.slorta.org/schedules/rta\">Central Coast Area Transit</a> (CCAT).<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Wireless Internet Access</h3>\n\n<p>San Luis Obispo jurors are now provided with <strong>free</strong> wireless Internet access during jury duty.

If you have an emergency and need emergency temporary orders before your hearing date in 30 days, then you may consider filing an Ex Parte Request for Order. An Ex Parte\u00a0Request for Order\u00a0requires additional forms and procedures from a regular Request for Order.</p>\n\n<p>Ex Parte Request for Order\u00a0are for emergencies only. Generally, an emergency is when there is or likely will be \u201cblood on the floor.\u201d This means that there is actual harm taking place or it is likely that if the court does not make an emergency order there will be harm.</p>\n\n<div>Examples of emergencies are:</div>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The other parent has taken the child, threatened that he/she will leave the state and hide, and you actually believe that they will do so.\u00a0You need an ex parte order that returns the child to you and prevents him from leaving the area with the child.</li>\n\t<li>Your child needs emergency medical treatment that requires both parents\u2019 consent and the other side refuses to give consent.\u00a0You need an ex parte order that allows you to have the authority to give consent.</li>\n\t<li>The other parent has just been charged with child abuse or child molestation of your child, and there is a visitation order in effect that allows visitation for the coming weekend.\u00a0You need an ex parte order that prevents visitation pending a full hearing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Unless there is a showing of immediate harm to the child or immediate risk that the child will be removed from the State of California, the judge may properly deny your request.<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Get Help</h3>\n\n<p>Our Self-Help Center offers a free workshop to answer all your general questions about requesting child support, custody and visitation orders.\u00a0\u00a0We will also review your forms and make your copies before you file.\u00a0 <a href=\"/documents/san-luis-obispo/Workshop-Flyer-RFO-with-QR-code.pdf\">Request for Order Workshop</a>.<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Do It Yourself</h3>\n\n<p>If you do not have an emergency situation and only need to file a regular Request for Order, we have a document preparation program available for you to use to complete the necessary forms to file a Request for Order.\u00a0 This program will ask you to answer questions that are needed to file a Request for Order.

Your declaration must explain all the reasons the court should grant the orders you are requesting.</p>\n\n<p>It is your job to give the judge facts, details, dates, description of events, etc. so the judge can reach the conclusion that is most favorable to you. In your declaration, you must answer the question about why the judge should grant the orders you are requesting. On the day of the hearing, you may forget to tell the judge your whole story. So, all the facts and details you want the judge to consider should be stated in your declaration.</p>\n\n<p>Your declaration may be up to 10 pages long,\u00a0doubled spaced using 12 point font. When writing or typing your declaration, keep in mind the judge will have to read this and refer to it at your hearing. Use descriptive headings for your paragraphs. This should tell the judge what the paragraph is about. You should start with the most important issue and the most recent event. When the judge is finished reading your declaration there should be no doubt about what you want, why you want it and why the judge should do what you want.<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Attaching Documents (Exhibits)</h3>\n\n<p>Exhibits are documents that support something you are saying in your declaration. If you believe there are documents the judge should read, you may attach them to your declaration. You must properly describe the document in your declaration by stating what the document is, what exhibit number you have assigned it and why the document is important for the judge to consider, e.g. \u201cAttached as Exhibit 1 is a true and correct copy of my paystubs for the last 3 months showing my gross monthly income is $1550.<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Forms

custody deals with the parents\u2019 right to make the decisions relating to the child\u2019s health, education and welfare.\u00a0 One or both parents can have legal custody.\u00a0 If both parents are making decisions about the child it is called joint legal custody.\u00a0 When writing your declaration you need to explain why it is in the child\u2019s best interest for one or both parents to make these decisions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Physical Custody</strong>: Physical custody deals with the days and times that the child will spend with each parent.\u00a0 If the child primarily lives with one parent it is called physical custody.\u00a0 If you are requesting that both parents spend a substantial period of time with the child, it is called Joint Physical Custody.\u00a0 When writing your declaration you need to explain why your proposed physical custody request is in the child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Visitation</strong>: Visitation is the time\u00a0the child spends with the parent who does not primarily live with the child.\u00a0 When writing your declaration you need to explain why your proposed visitation schedule is in the child\u2019s best interest.\u00a0 There are several options to choose from when it comes to visitation, generally they are: (1) Reasonable Visitation (2) Specific Visitation Schedule (3) Supervised Visitation.\u00a0 <em>Reasonable visitation</em> does not define the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child.\u00a0 A reasonable visitation court order usually works when both parents are in agreement about the time share that each is to have with the child.\u00a0 A <em>specific visitation schedule</em> defines the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child.\u00a0 A specific visitation schedule may be necessary for parents who have a difficult time agreeing on the days and times that each parent will spend with the child.\u00a0 <em>Supervised Visitation</em> requires that a responsible adult be present during any visitation times with the child.\u00a0 A supervised visitation order may be necessary if there are reasonable concerns that a parent may harm the child if left alone.\u00a0 You may request a non-professional or professional supervisor.\u00a0 Click here for more\u00a0information on <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/1190.htm\">Supervised Visitation</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Prevent Child Abduction</strong>:\u00a0 If there are facts that show that the other parent may be thinking of taking the child and hiding the child from you, then you may request orders to prevent the other parent from abducting the child.\u00a0 When writing your declaration you need to explain what the other party has done or plans to do to take and hide the child from you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Child Support</strong>:\u00a0 Both parents are required to financially support the minor child.\u00a0 Child support is the amount of money that one parent pays to the other to equalize the financial responsibility.\u00a0 The amount of child support is arrived by inputting several numbers into a formula.\u00a0 The main factors that are taken into consideration are: (1) Dad\u2019s gross monthly income (2) Mom\u2019s gross monthly income and (3) Percentage of time that is spent with the child.\u00a0 When writing your declaration, you must address each of these factors.\u00a0 The judge needs to know what you are claiming each of these numbers is and also how you arrived at those numbers.\u00a0 Other facts that may be discussed in your declaration are: (1) the other parent\u2019s ability to earn income, (2) the number of other biological children living with you (3) the amount of child care costs per month (4) the amount of rental income received (5) the amount of property taxes and mortgage interest paid per month and (6) the amount paid per month for health insurance premiums.\u00a0 You may attach any supporting documentation to your declaration as exhibits.\u00a0 Be prepared for what the amount of child support might be.\u00a0 Before you file your OSC, the Self-Help Center / Family Law Facilitator may help you calculate the amount of child support or you may go to <a href=\"https://www.cse.ca.gov/ChildSupport/cse/guidelineCalculator\">https://www.cse.ca.gov/ChildSupport/cse/guidelineCalculator</a> to calculate the child support amount on your own.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spousal Support</strong>:\u00a0 (formerly known as \u201cALIMONY\u201d):\u00a0 The judge has discretion to order the payment of spousal support.\u00a0 The judge will consider several factors before deciding whether to award spousal support, the amount of spousal support and the length of time that spousal support will be received.\u00a0 Some of the factors the judge will consider are:\u00a0 (1) Spouse\u2019s ability to pay spousal support (2) Other spouse\u2019s need to receive spousal support and (3) Standard of living during your marriage.\u00a0 When writing your declaration, you must address each of these factors.\u00a0 The judge needs to know what you think your spouse\u2019s income is and how you arrived at that number.\u00a0 In addition, your declaration must give details that describe your standard of living during the marriage which may include the number and kinds of vacations you took together, the kind of home you lived in, the kind of cars you owned, etc.Other factors that you may include in your declaration are the following: (1) Length of marriage (2) Age and health of each spouse (3) How much income each spouse can earn on their own (4) What the expenses of each spouse are (5) The history of the way the couple handled money during the marriage (6) Whether having a job would make it too hard to take care of the children (7) Whether one spouse helped the other get an education, training, career, or professional license (8) Whether there was domestic violence in the marriage or domestic partnership and (9) Whether one spouse's career was affected by unemployment, or by taking care of the children or home.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Attorney's Fees and Costs</strong>:\u00a0\u00a0You may request that the other party pay for your attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u00a0 The judge has discretion to grant or deny this request.\u00a0 When writing your declaration, you must establish in sufficient detail that the other party has the financial ability to pay your attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Property Restraint</strong>:\u00a0 You may request that the other party be prohibited from cashing out 401K\u2019s, checking accounts, savings accounts, etc.\u00a0 When writing your declaration, you must describe why this order is necessary.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Property Control</strong>:\u00a0 You may request an order giving you permission to use a car or live in the house.\u00a0 Your declaration must describe why this order is necessary.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other Relief</strong>:\u00a0 You may request any other relief not already covered.\u00a0 For example, you may request to (1) set aside default (2) change venue (3) reimbursement of half of uninsured health care expenses.\u00a0 Your declaration must describe why this order is necessary.<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Costs Involved</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Filing Fee</strong>: $60 filing fee for the regular Request for Order.\u00a0There is an additional fee of $25 to modify child custody or visitation orders.\u00a0There is an additional fee of $60 to request an ex parte hearing.\u00a0 The court will also charge a first appearance fee of $435 if it was not previously paid or waived. If you wish a record made of the proceedings, you must provide your own court reporter. If you do not have a court reporter present at your hearing, you will not be able to request a transcript of your hearing in the future.\u00a0If you need assistance in obtaining a court-approved list of pro tem reporters, contact the supervising court reporter at (805) 781-1132</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fee Waiver</strong>: If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you may obtain the forms to apply for a fee waiver at any of our Courthouses or you may click the links below.

A Court Trial requires you to post bail if you do not appear for arraignment. Posting bail pursuant to VC40519(b) constitutes a waiver of your right to a speedy trial within 45 days. Send a check or money order for the total bail or appear for an arraignment and enter your plea after which the court will set your trial date and notice you by mail.</p>\n\n<p>If you fail to appear at the time designated for your trial, either a trial in your absence will occur (Trial in Absentia), or a VC40508(a) charge may be added against you, which bears an additional penalty fee and a driver\u2019s license suspension until resolved.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, see <a href=\"/dv/traffic-contestcitation.htm#plead_not_guilty\">What happens when I plead not guilty?</a>.</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Accordon Item --><!-- Start Accordion Item -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"panelacc2368\" class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\">\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"panel-title\">\r\n        <a data-toggle=\"collapse\" role=\"button\" href=\"#acc2368\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"collapsed\" aria-controls=\"acc2368\">\r\n            What if I disagree with the outcome of my trial?\r\n        </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div aria-labelledby=\"panelacc2368\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" id=\"acc2368\">\r\n    <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>Any party may appeal an unfavorable decision made in the trial court to the appellate division of the superior court.

Mediation is a process of assisting parents in developing a parenting plan and is a neutral setting for discussing arrangements for the children, and to reduce acrimony and provide guidelines for parenting after separation or divorce. Mediation is a means of settling parenting disputes outside of court. Each parent is given the opportunity to be heard, and the objective is to develop parenting plans that meet the needs of the child/ren. Mediation is confidential from the Court process, and the mediator does not make recommendations to the Court if the parents are in disagreement. If an agreement is reached, the stipulation/agreement is submitted to the Court only after the parties have agreed in writing.</p>\n\n<p>For more information regarding the procedures for scheduling a mediation appointment, contact Family Court Services between the hours of 8:30 am and 4 pm on Monday through Thursday at (805) 706-3608.</p>\n\n<h4>Mediation by Phone</h4>\n\n<p>Family Court Services can accommodate requests for long distance and out of state telephone mediation for parents who reside outside San Luis Obispo County.

The evaluation is conducted by a court appointed evaluator. The focus of a child custody evaluation is to assess the individual and family factors that affect the best interests of the child/ren. The primary purpose and function of a child custody evaluation is to gather information about the family in a comprehensive and unbiased manner, and to report back to the court with a recommendation for a parenting plan that will help the child/ren maintain relationships with both parents\u00a0in a manner that\u00a0best serves his/her needs.</p>\n\n<p>To accomplish this end, a child custody evaluation usually includes (1) an assessment of each parent's historical involvement and current capacities for parenting and their ability to manage conflict; (2) an assessment of the child's functioning and developmental needs and the child's wishes where appropriate; and (3) an assessment of each parent's functional ability to meet the child's needs, which includes evaluation of the interaction between each adult and child.</p>\n\n<p>Some evaluations are much more limited in scope than others. This will be described in the evaluation order. Your evaluator will review the process for your family during your first appointment with them.</p>\n\n<p>If a custody evaluation is ordered by the court for your family, please be sure to read through the order carefully.\u00a0 We need your help to get things started, and the order will give you directions on how to proceed.\u00a0 Contact Family Court Services with any questions at 805-706-3608.</p>\n\n<p>With an ordered custody evaluation only,\u00a0we require that each parent fill out the following forms and deliver them to Family Court Services:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"/documents/san-luis-obispo/FCS_Intake_form.pdf\">Family Court Services Intake Form</a>\u00a0(AKA: Custody evaluation personal data sheet)</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"/documents/san-luis-obispo/Release_of_information_2.pdf\">Release of Information</a>\n\t<div class=\"noteModule\">\u200b<strong>NOTE:</strong> For full evaluations, please complete a release of information form for each treatment professional who is working with or has recently worked with you and your children (IE: schools, therapists, pediatricians).

Information on finding a non-profit organization is provided below.</p>\n\n<h4><strong>Community Work Service Instead of Paying Your Fine</strong></h4>\n\n<p>If you have been ordered by the Court to pay a fine you may choose to perform CWS instead of paying the fine. You may combine both work hours and payment.

When a Subpoena is directed to a person to appear in court, it is called a personal subpoena. When it is used to get a thing into court (like a photograph or sign), it is called a \u201cSubpoena Duces Tecum\u201d \u2013 which means, basically, Subpoena \u201cbring with you\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>In CA there is a mandatory form for Criminal and Traffic Court subpoenas that is published by the <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/cr125.pdf\">Judicial Council Subpoena Form CR-125</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>What Sort of Things Does a Subpoena Work For?</h4>\n\n<p>A Traffic Court Defendant in California can use a Subpoena to require any witness to appear in court. This includes police, bystanders who saw what happened, passengers, the person who maintains the machine, or the tow truck driver who impounded the car.</p>\n\n<p>A Subpoena can also be used to get things into trial such as photos, maintenance records, radar guns, video recordings, paperwork, etc.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to force a thing to come to court, you have to direct the subpoena to the \u201cCustodian of Records\u201d \u2013 or the person who is known to have possession or control over the item. Most large businesses and government agencies (including the CHP) have a person designated as the \u201cCustodian of Records\u201d who is responsible for responding to subpoenas.</p>\n\n<h4>How Does a Defendant Representing Themselves Get a Subpoena Issued?</h4>\n\n<p>In cases where a defendant represents themselves, (called \u201cpro per\u201d), the Defendant has the right to use a Subpoena, but they must get the court clerk to sign the completed Subpoena Form.</p>\n\n<p>You can download the <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/cr125.pdf\">Judicial Council Subpoena Form CR-125</a>. Then fill in as much information as possible and take it in person to the clerk\u2019s office for issuance. Once there, tell the clerk that you need to get the subpoena issued, give them the form\u00a0and ask for a signature and stamp.</p>\n\n<h4>Once a Subpoena is Issued by the Court Clerk, It Must Be Personally Served on the Witness or Custodian.</h4>\n\n<p>To be enforceable, a Subpoena must be personally handed to the person it is directed to. Defendants cannot serve the Subpoena themselves. There must be an Independent Person to Serve the Subpoena such as the Sheriff\u2019s Department Process Service.</p>\n\n<p>Once a Subpoena is served, the server must fill out the attached \u201cProof of Service\u201d so the service can be verified in court.</p>\n\n<p>There are time limits to serving a subpoena so that the witness or custodian has time to get ready. \u00a0At least 10 days is required for most things or witnesses.</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>"]},

Thereafter, you are asked which plea you want to enter.</p>\n\n<p>There are several pleas you can enter; the most common are:</p>\n\n<h4>Guilty Plea</h4>\n\n<p>If you plead guilty you can give the judge an explanation about what happened.</p>\n\n<p>If the judicial officer reduces your fine, he or she can order it be paid immediately, and, considering your prior convictions and any facts in aggravation, can increase the fine over the bail amount.</p>\n\n<h4>No Contest Plea</h4>\n\n<p>This is the same as a guilty plea <em>except </em>if you are involved in a civil suit (arising from your actions the citation was issued for) - such as a traffic accident - a no contest plea cannot be used against you in a later civil proceeding.</p>\n\n<p>If the judicial officer reduces your fine, he or she can order it be paid immediately, and, considering your prior convictions and any facts in aggravation, can increase the fine over the bail amount.</p>\n\n<h4>Not Guilty Plea</h4>\n\n<p>The judge will order your case scheduled for\u00a0trial to determine your innocence or guilt. <strong>You will be notified by mail of your court trial date and time to appear. It is your responsibility to assure that the court does have your correct mailing address and a phone number\u00a0where you can be contacted. </strong></p>\n\n<p>You may not give an explanation at arraignment since the facts will be covered at your trial.</p>\n\n<h4>Appearing in Court on a Failure to Appear</h4>\n\n<p>If your case is in a Failure to Appear status, you may contact the court for appearance location, dates and times that you may appear on your case. If you have relevant documentation to show the Traffic Commissioner such as proof of correction, a doctor\u2019s note, proof of incarceration, death certificate, or proof of financial situation, please bring that with you to court.<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Conduct During Court Proceedings<a name=\"court_conduct\"></a></h3>\n\n<p>During court you are expected to sit quietly and refrain from talking, chewing gum, reading newspapers, or other behavior that would distract the court and others.</p>\n\n<p>Shorts, tank tops, and other inappropriate attire are not permitted and you will not be allowed to appear if so dressed. Hats are not to be worn in the courtroom. No food, drinks, or weapons of any kind are allowed in the courtroom.</p>\n\n<p>Pagers, telephones, and other audible electronic devices are to be turned off or made silent before entering the courtroom.</p>\n</div>\r\n        \r\n    </div>"]},

There is evidence that the courts of that time summoned a body of sworn neighbors to put before the court crimes which had come to their knowledge. During the reign of Henry II (1154-1189) the Assize of Clarendon (1166) established the \"jury of presentment\"of twelve \"good and lawful men\" assembled to reveal the names of those suspected of crimes.</p>\n\n<p>The connection to our present grand jury system is clear. It was also during the reign of Henry II that juries divided into two types: civil and criminal, with the development of each influencing the other. The Massachusetts Bay Colony impaneled the first grand jury on our soil in 1635 to consider cases of murder, robbery and wife beating. By the end of the colonial period, the grand jury had become an important adjunct of government: \"they proposed new laws, protested against abuses in government, and wielded tremendous authority in their power to determine who should and should not face trial.\"</p>\n\n<p>Originally, the Constitution of the United States made no provision for a grand jury. But the Fifth Amendment ratified in 1791, guaranteed that \" ... no person shall be held to answer to a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or public danger ... .\" The Fourteenth Amendment (1868) made it illegal to deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law. Early California grand juries investigated local prisons, conducted audits of county books, and pursued matters of community interest.</p>\n\n<p>Under statues passed in 1880 the duties of the grand jury extended to investigation of county government. Only in seven other states do grand juries investigate county government beyond cases of alleged misconduct on the part of public officials. The County of San Luis Obispo impanels a civil grand jury every year. Its term coincides with the county's fiscal year, July 1st-June 30th. Its jurisdiction extends to all government entities in the County except those under state and federal authority. Superior Court judges recommend candidates from among those who volunteer for service.</p>\n\n<p>A drawing of nineteen jurors and eleven alternates then ensues. A superior court judge swears in the jurors. The objective of this process is a grand jury of qualified citizens prepared to donate the time required to do a successful job. The function of the grand jury is primarily that of a watchdog, ensuring that local government is performing with efficiency, impartiality, honesty, and for the benefit of the community.</p>\n\n<p>The citizens of the County of San Luis Obispo have a real asset in the grand jury. It provides them important information on how their county and local governments are conducting the peoples' business. For the members of the jury the work is difficult and time-consuming, but in the end, quite satisfying.<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Civil vs. Criminal Grand Jury?</h3>\n\n<p>There is no such thing in California law as a \"civil\" grand jury. California has historically had only \"regular\" grand juries and every county is required by the California Constitution to have one every year.</p>\n\n<p>The regular grand juries have always had two different functions: criminal and civil. One function, the criminal one, is to hear evidence to determine whether in the grand jury's view it is sufficient to warrant making an accused stand trial. Typically the District Attorney's office decides whom to accuse, on what charges and what evidence to bring to the attention of the grand jury. The District Attorney guides and advises the grand jury during its receipt of the evidence. The grand jury determines whether or not to issue an indictment. As discussed below, this indictment function has fallen into disuse in some, but not all, counties.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to standard criminal indictment activity, potentially included within the criminal function is the obligation of every regular grand jury to investigate \"willful or corrupt misconduct in office of public officers of every description within the county. Whether or not a grand jury's indictment function has fallen into disuse, this is a mandatory obligation and obviously may uncover criminal activity. The other function, the civil one, is to investigate local government agencies and officials to form a view as to whether they are acting properly. If a grand jury determines they are not, it has various options open to it.</p>\n\n<p>The most frequently used option is the presentation of a report outlining the grand jury's findings and recommendations in the matter. Such reports are public and frequently attract media attention. They must be responded to in specific ways by the agencies or elected officials reported upon.</p>\n\n<p>Except where an investigation is mandated, the grand jury in its sole discretion decides whether and what to investigate when performing its civil function. Depending on the nature and severity of any wrongdoing a grand jury finds in its investigations, it can, in addition to releasing a report, request the District Attorney to pursue the matter criminally, issue its own Accusation to start a court.'</p>\n\n<p>[PC\u00a7\u00a7901: Standards of Judicial Administration \u00a717(a) Cal.

It may be worth more than all of the other assets put together.&nbsp; There are very specific and technical rules that apply to pensions and you should get legal advice from a lawyer in order to protect your interest in the pension.&nbsp; In some cases, a pension plan must be \u201cjoined\u201d as a party in your divorce case before a judge will issue an order about how the pension will be divided. Read the <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl318info.pdf\">Retirement Plan Joinder - Information Sheet</a><em> </em>(FL-318-INFO) for more information about whether the pension plan must be joined in your divorce case.&nbsp; The court order that details how a pension will be divided is called a qualified domestic relations order, or QDRO. The QDRO must be approved by both the benefits provider and the judge to assure that the spouse/partner that is not the employee of the company or organization will receive those future benefits. A QDRO is an extremely complicated legal document and if you make a mistake, there can be harmful results.</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Accordon Item --><!-- Start Accordion Item -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"panelacc2474\" class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\">\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"panel-title\">\r\n        <a data-toggle=\"collapse\" role=\"button\" href=\"#acc2474\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"collapsed\" aria-controls=\"acc2474\">\r\n            Preliminary &amp; Final Declaration of Disclosure\r\n        </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div aria-labelledby=\"panelacc2474\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" id=\"acc2474\">\r\n    <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>California law requires that you and your spouse give each other written information about all the income, expenses, assets and debts that you know to exist.&nbsp; This act of revealing and making something known to the other person is called \"disclosure.\"&nbsp; Disclosure is required at the beginning of the case (Preliminary) and end of the case (Final).&nbsp; Disclosure is intended to make sure that you and your spouse are aware of everything each of you own and owe.&nbsp; With this information you can divide your&nbsp;assets and debts equally, and can make reasonable decisions about support.

Reasonable visitation does not define the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child.&nbsp;A reasonable visitation court order usually works when both parents are in agreement about the time share that each is to have with the child.&nbsp;A specific visitation schedule defines the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child.&nbsp;A specific visitation schedule may be necessary for parents who have a difficult time agreeing on the days and times that each parent will spend with the child.&nbsp;Supervised Visitation requires that a responsible adult be present during any visitation times with the child.&nbsp;A supervised visitation order may be necessary if there are reasonable concerns that a parent may harm the child if left alone.&nbsp; You may request a non-professional or professional supervisor.&nbsp; Click here for more&nbsp;information on <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/1190.htm\">Supervised Visitation</a>.</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Accordon Item --><!-- Start Accordion Item -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"panelacc2478\" class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\">\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"panel-title\">\r\n        <a data-toggle=\"collapse\" role=\"button\" href=\"#acc2478\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"collapsed\" aria-controls=\"acc2478\">\r\n            Child Support\r\n        </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div aria-labelledby=\"panelacc2478\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" id=\"acc2478\">\r\n    <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>To determine the amount of guideline child support that the Court may order in your case, visit <a href=\"http://www.childsup.ca.gov/\">www.childsup.ca.gov</a> and click on Calculate Child Support.</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Accordon Item --><!-- Start Accordion Item -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"panelacc2479\" class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\">\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"panel-title\">\r\n        <a data-toggle=\"collapse\" role=\"button\" href=\"#acc2479\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"collapsed\" aria-controls=\"acc2479\">\r\n            Notice of Related Cases\r\n        </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div aria-labelledby=\"panelacc2479\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" id=\"acc2479\">\r\n    <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>If another cases exists that involves the same parties and issues like child custody, support or restraining orders then a Notice of Related Case should be filed.</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Accordon Item --><!-- Start Accordion Item -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"panelacc2480\" class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\">\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"panel-title\">\r\n        <a data-toggle=\"collapse\" role=\"button\" href=\"#acc2480\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"collapsed\" aria-controls=\"acc2480\">\r\n            Update Contact Information\r\n        </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div aria-labelledby=\"panelacc2480\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" id=\"acc2480\">\r\n    <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>Parties must serve and file MC-040 Notice of Change of Address or Other Contact Information to keep each other and the court informed of their contact information.</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Accordon Item -->\n                    \n                    <div class=\"clear25\"></div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<!-- End Accordion Module (+ and - icons) --> \r\n                                                    </div>  \r\n                                                </div>                             \r\n                                            "]},

ADR programs provide alternative ways to resolve your dispute. Generally, these include using a neutral third party to help you find a resolution. While the court may be considered the original \u201cneutral third party\u201d, most people find litigation (court procedures) to be time consuming, stressful, and expensive. ADR programs are here to offer you an option that can bring closure more efficiently and in some ways, more effectively.\n\n<p>San Luis Obispo County Superior Court ADR programs include Mediation and Arbitration. <a href=\"http://www.slobar.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=89&amp;Itemid=13\">View&nbsp;a list of the mediators</a> that can be found in the Mediation Binders located in all civil courtrooms.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Mediation</h4>\n\n<p>Mediation is fair, voluntary, confidential, and flexible. Choosing mediation allows you to try and resolve the situation based on what\u2019s most important to you.The mediator facilitates a productive process to help break down the barriers in communication that often go up due to conflict, and to explore options allowing parties to arrive at a mutual, acceptable resolution.The mediator does not decide the dispute; the parties retain power over the outcome.<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Arbitration</h4>\n\n<p>Arbitration is normally an informal process in which a neutral person (the arbitrator) decides the dispute after hearing the evidence and arguments of the parties.The parties can agree to binding or non-binding arbitration.Binding arbitration is designed to give each side a resolution of their dispute when they cannot agree between themselves or with a mediator. If the arbitration is non-binding, any party can reject the arbitrator\u2019s decision and request a trial. Generally arbitration must be ordered by the court. In San Luis Obispo Superior Court if there is an order for non-binding arbitration, arrangements are made through Jury Services.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.calbar.ca.gov/Public/Pamphlets/ResolveaDispute.aspx\">Learn more on how to resolve disputes</a> from the State Bar of California<br/>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">What are the potential advantages of ADR?</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>ADR can <strong>save time and money</strong>. ADR, especially when used early in a dispute, can save a lot of time and money. Even when ADR does not result in an immediate resolution, it can produce savings by clarifying and narrowing the scope of the dispute.</li>\n\t<li>ADR provides <strong>increased flexibility and control</strong>. ADR typically gives you greater flexibility and control in the dispute resolution process - in the procedures followed, the interests considered and the remedies adopted - than you would have in a court trial. In mediation, for example, you can work out a resolution that may not be available in court.</li>\n\t<li>ADR is generally <strong>confidential</strong>. Confidentiality encourages openness and candor, and is considered an important factor in the effectiveness of ADR.</li>\n\t<li>ADR can <strong>improve communication and preserve relationships</strong>. Some ADR processes are designed to reduce the hostility created by the dispute and to help each side communicate with the other. This is particularly true of mediation. The aim of mediation is to create a cooperative atmosphere in which both sides can find \"win-win\" solutions that will preserve or improve, rather than further damage, the relationship.</li>\n\t<li>ADR can give you <strong>a chance to tell your side of the story</strong>. Some ADR processes will permit you to tell your side of the story in a way that cannot be done in court. This opportunity for both sides to be heard can make the difference between a satisfying or frustrating dispute resolution process.</li>\n\t<li>ADR can <strong>reduce stress and increase satisfaction</strong>. Litigation can be highly stressful. Lack of control over the process and outcome, prolonged uncertainty and mounting costs all contribute to such stress. The benefits of many ADR processes - reduced expense, confidentiality, a quicker process, an out-of-court setting and greater control for those involved, for example - often make them less stressful.</li>\n</ul></p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div> \r\n                                                    </div>  \r\n                                                </div>                             \r\n                                            "]},
