The first is \"irreconcilable differences\", meaning that at least one party asserts that the marriage cannot be saved. The other reason is \"incurable insanity\" which, unlike irreconcilable differences, must be proven.\n\n</p><h4>Dissolution of Marriage (Divorce):</h4>\n\n<p>A dissolution of marriage, which is more commonly known as divorce, terminates the marriage and resolves marital issues including child custody, visitation, child support, spousal support, asset and debt division (real and personal property), former name restoration, restraining orders, and other issues identified by the parties. You must wait 6 months from the date the respondent was served with the divorce documents. You will then have to submit judgment paperwork to the court for a Judge\u2019s signature before you are legally divorced. For current filing fees click here.</p>\n\n<h4>Summary Dissolution:</h4>\n\n<p>If you and your spouse are in agreement that you want to divorce you may be able to obtain a summary dissolution. The criteria for a summary dissolution include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>You were married for under five years,</li>\n\t<li>There were no children born during the marriage,</li>\n\t<li>You have very few community assets and debts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Legal Separation:</h4>\n\n<p>Legal separation is similar to dissolution of marriage, except that the parties remain married to each other. The court may make orders regarding the same issues identified in a dissolution of marriage.</p>\n\n<p>If you open a legal separation action, you may amend your petition prior to judgment to request a dissolution of marriage. That will allow you to \"start the clock\" on the waiting period for divorce (six months from date of service), provided that you follow some special instructions.</p>\n\n<h4>Nullity:</h4>\n\n<p>A nullity is more commonly known as an annulment of marriage. This may only be requested if a party alleges incest, bigamy, minor without parental consent, unsound mind, fraud, force or incapacity to consummate marriage.</p>\n\n<h4>Domestic Partnerships:</h4>\n\n<p>Dissolution of a domestic partnership terminates the partnership. You must be a resident of the state of California, both parties do not have to agree to the dissolution and it takes a minimum of six months for this action to become final.</p>\n\n<h4>Child and Spousal Support:</h4>\n\n<p>To obtain or modify family support orders, establish parentage, or enforce existing family support orders, the Department of Child Support Services is available to assist you. Information concerning this office is available at the California Department of Child Support Services website, or by telephone, 1-866-901-3212.</p>\n\n<h4>Adoptions: Private and Stepparent:</h4>\n\n<p>Before granting a petition for adoption, the court authorizes an investigation of the adoptive parents(s), regardless of whether they are related to the children or stepparents. Parties are required to pay for these investigations. Typically, the court will also consider petitions to terminate parental rights of the parent(s) who are relinquishing their children in this process.</p>\n\n<h4>Domestic Violence:</h4>\n\n<p>Parties alleging domestic violence may file for a Domestic Violence Restraining Order.</p>\n\n<h4>Establishment of Parental Relationship:</h4>\n\n<p>These are also called \"paternity cases\". The court may make findings or parental relationship in these matters that will have an effect on child support, visitation and custody.</p>\n\n<h4>Child Custody, Support and Visitation:</h4>\n\n<p>Even after marital and domestic partnership issues have been resolved, the court retains jurisdiction over issues that affect minor children in these proceedings until these children reach 18 years of age (or 19 years of age if still in high school). Parties may file motions to modify custody, support and visitation any time the circumstances warrant such filings.</p>\n\n<h4>Emancipation of Minors:</h4>\n\n<p>A minor may petition the court for a declaration of emancipation if the minor is at least 14 years of age, willingly lives separately from parents, and managing his own personal financial affairs.</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div> \r\n                                                    </div>  \r\n                                                </div>                             \r\n                                            </div>"], "links_title": ["Fee Schedule", "Family Law Attorney", "Local Forms", "Small Claims", "Fee Waivers", "Limited Civil Cases", "Unlimited Civil Cases"], "url": "https://www.mono.courts.ca.gov/divisions/familylaw.htm"},

If there is no one close to the conservatee who is able to act on his or her behalf, the Public Guardian may be appointed.</p>\n\n<h2>How to begin a conservatorship?</h2>\n\n<p>Forms are state forms, they can be found at www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm under Probate \u2013 Guardianships and Conservatorships. When you have completed the forms, they must be filed with the Civil Clerk's office.</p>\n\n<h2>How much does it cost for a conservatorship?</h2>\n\n<p>See the fee schedule for fees to file the petition. There are additional fees for investigation services. If fees present a hardship, you may be eligible for a fee waiver. The Request to Waive Court Fees (FW-001) is the basic fee waiver form. For additional fees a (FW-002) is required.

An investigator will interview the proposed conservatee and conservator(s) and any other agencies or individuals who may be able to provide information to the court. The investigator will prepare a report for the courts consideration.</p>\n\n<h2>How long does the investigation take?</h2>\n\n<p>The investigation process will begin after you file your petition and will be completed before your hearing date, usually within two to four weeks.</p>\n\n<h2>How does the court monitor a conservatorship?</h2>\n\n<p>Probate code 1850 states that every conservatorship shall be reviewed by the court six months after the appointment, one year after the appointment and annually after that. The court investigator will visit the conservatee and speak with the conservator and any other persons or agencies providing services to the conservatee. The investigator will prepare a report for the court so the court may determine if the conservatorship continues to be appropriate and in the best interest of the conservatee.</p>\n\n<h2>What happens if it appears the conservatee is being abused, neglected or financially exploited?</h2>\n\n<p>Adult Protective Services is the agency charged with investigating allegations of abuse and neglect of adults. If the alleged victim is conserved, Adult Protective Services and Family Law work together to resolve problems and provide for the well being of the victim. Mono County protective services telephone number is (TBD).</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div> \r\n                                                    </div>  \r\n                                                </div>                             \r\n                                            </div>"], "url": "https://www.mono.courts.ca.gov/divisions/probateconservatorship.htm"},

The petition does not prove that the minor committed these acts and there will be opportunities at court hearings to present evidence regarding the minor's involvement in the alleged criminal acts.</p>\n\n<p>For those who cannot afford legal representation for their children, the Court will appoint an attorney. Please note that this attorney represents the child only and will not represent the parents or guardians.</p>\n\n<p>The objectives of the Delinquency Court are to:</p>\n\n<p>If a minor becomes a ward of the Delinquency Court, the Court will make orders for the parents or guardians and the minor. The minor may be allowed to live in the parents' or guardians' home under Court supervision or may be placed outside of the home in an unlocked or locked facility.

Personal services means the person personally gave a copy of the court papers to the defendant.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Substituted service.</strong> Substituted service occurs when a person other than the defendant is served on the defendant\u2019s behalf so long as the papers are served (i) at the defendant\u2019s business with the person in charge; or (ii) at the defendant\u2019s home with a competent person who is at least 18 years old. The person who receives the court papers must be told about their contents. Another copy of the same court papers must be mailed, first class, postage prepaid, to the defendant at the address where the paper was left. The service is not complete until 10 days after the copy is mailed.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Certified mail</strong>. For small claims cases only, you may ask the Clerk of the Court to serve the defendant by certified mail. The clerk will charge a fee of $15.00 for this service. You should check back with the court prior to the hearing to see if the receipt for certified mail was returned to the court. Service by certified mail can only be accomplished by the Clerk of the Court.<br>\n\t<br>\n\tThe person who completes service as stated above must complete the Proof of Service form, <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc104.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Judicial Council Form SC-104</a>, and have it filed with the Court.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>PROOF OF SERVICE MUST BE FILED WITH THE COURT PRIOR TO THE HEARING DATE. If there is no proof of service on file the matter may be continued. The Plaintiff must then request the matter be reset.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>YOU CANNOT SERVE PAPERS ON THE DEFENDANT YOURSELF. YOU MUST USE A NON-PARTY.</strong> Professional process servers are available for hire, and the sheriff\u2019s department may also serve legal papers for a fee.</p>\n\n<p>The defendant must be served at least 15 days before the trial date if he or she lives in the county, and at least 20 days if the defendant lives outside the county. If service is not completed in time, the trial will be continued (postponed). If service is accomplished by substituted service or by certified mail, you must allow 10 ten additional days.</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Accordon Item --><!-- Start Accordion Item -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"panelacc4131\" role=\"tab\" class=\"panel-heading\">\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"panel-title\">\r\n        <a aria-expanded=\"false\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" class=\"collapsed\" aria-controls=\"acc4131\" href=\"#acc4131\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" role=\"button\">\r\n            How do I prepare my case?\r\n        </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"acc4131\" role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"panelacc4131\">\r\n    <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>You may prepare your own case, or consult with an attorney about the applicable law and preparation for trial.

Small claims court is informal, so you do not have to know the law; however it will improve your chances for success if you can distill the essential elements of the case and present them to the court in a clear and concise manner.</p>\n\n<p>The opposing side is entitled to see all evidence before it is submitted to the court; therefore, if you plan to bring documents to show the court, you need to make extra copies for the other side, and for the judge. It will save time if you can each have a copy to refer to in court.</p>\n\n<p>Be sure you are on time for the trial. Although the small claims trial is informal, you must be prepared with witnesses, books, receipts and other documents needed to prove your case. If your witnesses are not willing to come to court voluntarily, you can request that the court clerk issue a <strong>subpoena</strong>. A subpoena is a court order that requires the witness to appear. The witness has a right to charge a fee for appearing. If you do not have in your possession the records or papers necessary to prove your case, you may request the court clerk issue a <strong>subpoena <em>duces tecum</em></strong> in advance of the trial date, which orders the documents you are requesting be delivered to court for trial.</p>\n\n<p>Many cases are scheduled for the same time, so each case is given limited time. You should describe the events clearly and concisely. Before you present to the court any photographs, diagrams or documents, you must first show them to the opposing side. If possible, observe other small claims proceedings in the same department or courtroom where your case is scheduled, prior to the day you are to appear. You will get an idea how to proceed in an organized manner due to the limited time available for each case.</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Accordon Item --><!-- Start Accordion Item -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"panelacc4130\" role=\"tab\" class=\"panel-heading\">\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"panel-title\">\r\n        <a aria-expanded=\"false\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" class=\"collapsed\" aria-controls=\"acc4130\" href=\"#acc4130\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" role=\"button\">\r\n            Where do I get the forms to file a claim?\r\n        </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"acc4130\" role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"panelacc4130\">\r\n    <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>You can complete forms online for free at <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm\">www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm</a>.</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Accordon Item --><!-- Start Accordion Item -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"panelacc4129\" role=\"tab\" class=\"panel-heading\">\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"panel-title\">\r\n        <a aria-expanded=\"false\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" class=\"collapsed\" aria-controls=\"acc4129\" href=\"#acc4129\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" role=\"button\">\r\n            I need to change my hearing date\r\n        </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"acc4129\" role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"panelacc4129\">\r\n    <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>Either party can ask for a later hearing date.

To be added to the docket/calendar, you should arrive at 8:30 a.m.</div>\n\n<p>Criminal cases range from relatively minor offenses such as traffic infractions to serious ones like robbery and murder. The State, as the protector of all the people, makes the charge against someone accused of committing a crime because a crime is considered an act against society. Only the State, through the office of the District Attorney in each county, can charge individuals with criminal violations. The prosecuting attorney presents the charge against the accused person (defendant) on behalf of the State (plaintiff), and must prove to the judge or jury that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n\n<p>California statutes generally classify a crime as either a felony or a misdemeanor. A felony is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment in a state prison or by death. A misdemeanor is a lesser offense than a felony and generally is punishable by fine or imprisonment in county jail rather than in a state penitentiary.</p>\n\n<p>If you are the victim of a crime, there are resources available to you.

This date is listed on the bottom of your citation and on your Notice of Bail. You have several options for resolving your case without appearing in court, unless your appearance is mandatory (infractions are not court mandatory). If you wish to appear in court you must place yourself on calendar by appearing on the date and time listed on your citation and Notice of Bail.

In addition, a hold may be placed on your driving privilege. <strong>IF YOU SIGNED THE TICKET, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING CARE OF THE TICKET.</strong></p>\n\n<h4>Financial hardship and ability to pay.</h4>\n\n<p>If you have a financial hardship and can show you are unable to pay the full amount for the offenses on your citation, you may request the court to consider your ability to pay. However, you must explain your financial situation to the court in person or mail the completed <a href=\"/documents/mono/Inability_to_Pay_Forms.pdf\">Can't Afford to Pay Fine</a> forms which can be also be obtained at the court clerk's office. If you appear in court and plead \"guilty\" at arraignment, you may request that the court considers your ability to pay in reducing the fine to be paid. If you plead \"not guilty\" and after a trial and conviction, you may request that the court considers your ability to pay in deciding the fine ordered for the offenses (Veh. Code \u00a7 42003(c)). Once the court determines your ability to pay you can ask it to reconsider if your financial circumstances change.</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div><!-- Start Accordion Module (+ and - icons) -->\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n        <h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n        <div class=\"accordion-wrapper\">\n            \n            <div class=\"controls\">\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"expandall\">expand all</a> <a href=\"#\" class=\"collapseall\">collapse all</a> \n            </div>\n            <br>\n            <div aria-multiselectable=\"true\" id=\"bs-accordion\" role=\"tablist\" class=\"panel-group\">\n                <div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        <!-- Start Accordion Item -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"panelacc4151\" role=\"tab\" class=\"panel-heading\">\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"panel-title\">\r\n        <a aria-expanded=\"false\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" class=\"collapsed\" aria-controls=\"acc4151\" href=\"#acc4151\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" role=\"button\">\r\n            I just got a traffic citation (ticket) a few hours ago; what is my bail amount?\r\n        </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"acc4151\" role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"panelacc4151\">\r\n    <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>Court staff in unable to provide the bail amount on an unfiled citation.

Although the Facilitator can help everyone, priority is given to those parents who cannot afford to hire an attorney. If the Facilitator has time, they can help with other family law problems the parents may have.</p>\n\n<p>The Facilitator <strong>CAN</strong>: explain the court process to you, mediate disputes about child custody and spousal support, step parent adoptions, guardianships, name changes, help you prepare for court, refer you to the Family Support Division and other community resources, answer other family law questions that you may have and provide you with information on how to handle the important issues of child support, spousal support, paternity, custody and visitation.</p>\n\n<p>The Facilitator <strong>CANNOT</strong>: represent you in court or give you legal advice regarding your particular case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For your meeting with the Facilitator, you must bring:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>A copy of any court documents relating to your case</li>\n\t<li>Income and expense information</li>\n\t<li>Your last three paycheck stubs, or AFDC invoice</li>\n\t<li>A copy of your last tax return</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Upon arrival, you will be asked to fill out an Intake Form. If you need to fill out forms to proceed with your case, you may obtain these from the Facilitator. The Facilitator has instructional material that will show you how to fill out these forms.</p>\n\n<p>If you need legal advice, the Facilitator will assist you in finding an attorney to help you.</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div> \r\n                                                    </div>  \r\n                                                </div>                             \r\n                                            </div>"], "links_title": ["Family Law", "Child Custody Counselor", "Local Forms"], "links_href": ["https://www.mono.courts.ca.gov/divisions/familylaw.htm", "https://www.mono.courts.ca.gov/divisions/familylaw-childcustody.htm", "https://www.mono.courts.ca.gov/generalinfo/localrules.htm"]},

You may not appeal on behalf of a friend, a spouse, a child, or another relative unless you are a legally appointed representative for that person (such as a guardian or conservator).</p>\n\n<h4>Do I need a lawyer to file an appeal?</h4>\n\n<p>Not generally. But appeals are very complicated, and take a lot of time, effort and money. You have to do all the paperwork correctly, meet the deadlines, and follow all the court's rules and procedures. If you make mistakes, your case may be dismissed and you may have to pay the appeal costs of the other side.</p>\n\n<p>Also, a lawyer can help you decide if you can or should file an appeal. A lawyer might know how to get what you want faster and cheaper by using a different legal process. Many lawyers do not do appeals, so make sure you talk to a lawyer who specializes in appeals. A lawyer who has done some appeals and knows how to handle them will know what to do when, and can guide your case through the appeal process.</p>\n\n<p>You can proceed with your appeal on your own, but given the particular nature of your case, you may want to consult with a lawyer.</p>\n\n<h4>How much does it cost to file an appeal?</h4>\n\n<p>For fees relating to civil appeals, please see the current fee schedule for Mono County Superior Court (Statewide Civil Fee Schedule), which can be found here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you are low-income, you may be able to qualify for a fee waiver and not have to pay a filing fee.

You can find contact and other information for the Courts of Appeal at <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/3dca.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Courts of Appeal</a>. The Third District Court of Appeal is located in Sacramento, California.</p>\n\n<h4>What types of civil cases does the Court of Appeal deal with?</h4>\n\n<p>The Courts of Appeal handle appeals in unlimited civil cases (civil cases in which the amount claimed is over $25,000). Courts of Appeal also decide certain cases that do not get filed at the superior court and instead must be filed at the court of appeal, like petitions such as mandamus, prohibition and certiorari in unlimited civil cases.</p>\n\n<p>There are six appellate districts, each with a Court of Appeal.

You may also ask for an interpreter printing the <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/int300.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Interpreter Request Form</a> and bringing it into our Clerk's Office, or fill out and email this form using the email address found on the form. It is important to notify the court as soon as possible if an interpreter is needed. If you wait until your court date, you may have to wait until an interpreter can be contacted. If an interpreter is not available at the time of your hearing, your case may be continued until an interpreter can be assigned.\n\n</p><p><strong>What if I need an interpreter, but the court does not provide one?</strong><br>\nThe court will not provide you with an interpreter except in the case types listed above. If you need an interpreter to help you understand what is said during one of these court proceedings, you must bring a certified, registered or provisionally qualified interpreter to interpret for you. You may not bring anyone under the age of 18 to interpret for you. For a list of qualified interpreters, please check the Judicial Council website, <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/3796.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Search for an Interpreter</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What if I need a sign language interpreter?</strong><br>\nThe court will provide you with a sign language interpreter for any court hearing you may have. The court will also provide you with a sign language interpreter if you are called for jury duty. Please tell a clerk at the counter or in the courtroom as soon as possible if you will need a sign language interpreter. For more information on this and other Access and Accommodation needs please visit the <a href=\"/generalinfo/ada.htm\">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</a> page on this site.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are you interested in becoming a Court Interpreter?</strong><br>\nDue to the limited resources of certified/registered interpreters statewide, the court may sometimes provide a provisionally qualified interpreter (non-certified, non-registered for the mandated areas listed above). As a court interpreter, you will play a key role in our trial courts by interpreting for defendants, litigants and witnesses thereby helping to insure access to the Limited English Proficiency (LEP) customers.

The Courts are always searching for new solutions for these issues including more efficient use of existing resources to help improve and expand language access around the state.

These are important decisions. Sometimes they are the most difficult. California law states that when parents cannot reach an agreement, they must first meet with a professional mediator before their hearing.</p>\n\n<p>Mediators for Mono County Superior Court are not \u201c Child Custody &amp; Visitation Mediations\u201d. This means our court mediators do not make custody recommendations to the court. The role of the Mono County Superior Court mediators is to help parents to reach agreement regarding custody and visitation that can be presented to the court.</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div><div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n                        <h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Child Custody</h3>\r\n                            \r\n         \r\n        <p>Since you have filed documents that seek an order for child custody or visitation, you have been referred to mediation prior to the hearing date. This mediation is mandatory, and your case will not be heard in the court until you have completed mediation. It is your responsibility to contact one of the court-approved mediators on the list that is provide on the link on this webpage and arrange for mediation prior to the court date.\n\n</p><p>Mediation is required by the court because approximately 65% of the cases regarding child custody and visitation are resolved in mediation and there is no need for the parties to appear in court for an order. The process is very simple. Both parents meet with a third party mediator. The job for that mediator is to help the parents arrive at an agreement for child custody and visitation. The mediator cannot make an order, and in our county the mediator does not make any recommendation to the judge. What is discussed in mediation is confidential and will be not be shared with the court.</p>\n\n<p>It is highly recommended that you watch a video prepared by the California state Judicial Council before going to your mediation. It will help you form the frame of mind needed to successfully complete the mediation. The video is excellent, but before you watch it you must understand the difference between recommending mediation (called recommending counselling in the video), and non-recommending mediation. If the parties cannot reach an agreement in a recommending county, the mediator will prepare and forward to the court a recommended temporary custody and visitation plan. If the parties cannot reach an agreement in a non-recommending county (that\u2019s us), the mediator merely checks a box that there is no agreement and the parties argue before the judge at the hearing. We are a non-recommending mediation County, that means your mediator will make no recommendation to the court and you will need to argue your case before the judge regarding custody and visitation.</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div><div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n                        <h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Goals of Child Custody &amp; Visitation Mediation</h3>\r\n                            \r\n         \r\n        <p></p><ol>\n\t<li>To help parents create a parenting plan that is in the best interests of their child(ren).</li>\n\t<li>To help parents develop a parenting plan that enables their child(ren) to have contact with parents in ways that are appropriate for the safety and wellbeing of the child(ren).</li>\n\t<li>Help parents learn to co-parent.</li>\n</ol>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div><div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n                        <h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Setting a Date for Child Custody Recommending Counseling</h3>\r\n                            \r\n         \r\n        <p>The date and time for child custody &amp; visitation mediation is arranged with the mediator.\n\n</p><h4>Who should I bring to attend the Child Custody &amp; Visitation Mediation?</h4>\n\n<p>Do not bring your child(ren), friends, relative, spouse, significant others\u2026 with you to the mediation. Mediation is just for the parents. The parents can have a silent support person with them in session.</p>\n\n<h4>If the children don\u2019t go to mediation, how will the child(ren)\u2019s wishes and needs be considered?</h4>\n\n<p>Their wishes and needs will be considered by you, the other parent(s) and the court. The parents are the people who know your child(ren) best, and they are the best people to determine what your child(ren)\u2019s living arrangements should be. As you work with the mediator, the mediator will help you understand the choices available to parents, arrangements that often work well for children your child(ren)\u2019s ages, what children need as their parents are separating, and how parents can best meet these needs. The mediator will help you and the other parent address your parenting concerns and focus on what you each parent believes is best for the child(ren).</p>\n\n<h4>My child wants to talk with the judge. Should I bring them to court for the hearing?</h4>\n\n<p>No. If you believe your child(ren) wishes to speak with the judge, then explain that in your court paperwork. Do not bring your child(ren) to court unless a judge or a commissioner specifically tells you.</p>\n\n<h4>What if the other parent doesn\u2019t go to the mediation appointment?</h4>\n\n<p>Keep your court date. When you return to court, then the judge/commissioner will decide what should happen next.</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div><div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n                        \r\n                            \r\n         \r\n        <p>For further information, including a free parent education course, and additional resources to help families understand the divorce and separation process, please see these links:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.parenting.familieschange.ca.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">www.parenting.familieschange.ca.gov</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.familieschange.ca.gov/\">www.familieschange.ca.gov</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.changeville.ca.gov/\">www.changeville.ca.gov</a></p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div> \r\n                                                    </div>  \r\n                                                </div>                             \r\n                                            </div>"], "links_title": ["Fee Schedule", "Family Law Attorney", "Local Forms", "Small Claims", "Fee Waiver", "Limited Civil Cases", "Unlimited Civil Cases"], "url": "https://www.mono.courts.ca.gov/divisions/familylaw-childcustody.htm"},

Only a sheriff can evict someone. Even if a tenant is months behind on rent, the landlord cannot evict the tenant or get rid of the tenant's belongings. The landlord must get a court order for the sheriff to evict a tenant.</p>\n\n<h2>What do I need to do to get the tenant out?</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Serve the tenant with a notice (see below for more information)</li>\n\t<li>Wait for the notice period to end</li>\n\t<li>File an Unlawful Detainer action if the tenant doesn't do what the noticed asked</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>What forms do I need to file with the court to get the tenant out if he/she does not comply with notice?</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Original Complaint (<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ud100.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">UD-100</a>)</li>\n\t<li>Original Civil Case Cover Sheet (<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/cm010.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CM-010</a>)</li>\n\t<li>Original Summons (<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sum130.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">SUM-130</a>)</li>\n\t<li>Copy of the Notice (Demand Notice)</li>\n\t<li>Copy of the Rental Agreement (Optional)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>What if I cannot afford the court fees and costs?</h2>\n\n<p>Both the Plaintiff and Defendant may submit a Waiver of Court Fees and Costs (<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fw001.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FW-001</a>) and an Order on Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs (<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fw003.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FW-003</a>). If there is more than one Plaintiff/Defendant, each Plaintiff/Defendant must file his/her own fee waiver application and order.</p>\n\n<h2>I served the tenant. How do I get a court date?</h2>\n\n<p>When the tenant files an answer, the landlord must ask for a court date using Request/Counter-Request to Set Case for Trial-Unlawful Detainer (<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ud150.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">UD-150</a>). A copy must be mailed to each answering tenant before filing. The court date must be set within 20 days and notice will be mailed to all parties by the Court.</p>\n\n<h2>What forms do I need for a Default/Clerk's Judgment and possession?</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Original Proof of Service (<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/pos010.pdf\">POS-010</a>)(separate one for each tenant)</li>\n\t<li>Request for Entry of Default (<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/civ100.pdf\">CIV-100</a>)</li>\n\t<li>Judgment by Default by Clerk (UD-110)</li>\n\t<li>Writ of Possession (<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej130.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">EJ-130</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Can a lock-out be delayed?</h2>\n\n<p>Yes, the tenant may file a motion for stay of execution. This allows the tenant to stay for up to 41 additional days as long as he/she can pay the rent for the extra time in advance.</p>\n\n<h2>Why did I receive a notice in the mail?</h2>\n\n<p>A Notice of Filing Unlawful Detainer Complaint (C.C.P. \u00a71161.2) is required to be mailed, by the court, to each tenant named on the Complaint. For more information seek legal advice.</p>\n\n<h2>How long do I have to file an answer to Unlawful Detainer?</h2>\n\n<p>You have five (5) calendar days, excluding Judicial Holidays, from the date you were served to file an answer to an Unlawful Detainer action. If you do not file an answer within that time, the landlord may file for a default judgment.</p>\n\n<h2>What forms do I need to respond to the Summons and Complaint?</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Answer (<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ud105.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">UD-105</a>)</li>\n\t<li>Proof of Service by Mail (UDL/E-8)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Before you file your answer with the court, you must first serve a copy to the plaintiff or plaintiff's attorney if represented. It can be served by mail or in person, but may not be served by a person who is a plaintiff or defendant in the case. The answer does not need to be received by the landlord prior to Defendant filing the answer with the Court.</p>\n\n<h2>I cannot be present for my court date. Can I send someone else in my place?</h2>\n\n<p>No. Only you or your attorney may represent you in court.</p>\n\n<h2>How can I change the court date?</h2>\n\n<p>Unlawful Detainer cases must be set no later then 20 days after the first request. You cannot request a change of court date over the phone. Please seek legal advice as to how to change your hearing.</p>\n\n<h2>Serving the Notice</h2>\n\n<p>Someone other than the landlord, who is over the age of 18, must serve the notice. There are three ways to serve the notice:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Personal Service - the notice is given to the person (s) to be evicted in person.</li>\n\t<li>Substitute Service - If the tenant is not at their normal home or work, you can leave a copy with a person over the age of 18. You must then also mail a copy to their home.</li>\n\t<li>\"Nail and Mail\" - If you don't know where the tenant lives or works, or can't find someone over the age of 18 to give a copy to, you can\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li>attach a copy in a place where it can be seen easily, and</li>\n\t\t<li>give a copy to the person who lives there, if you can find one, and</li>\n\t\t<li>mail a copy to the defendant at the property.</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If at the end of the notice period the tenant has not done what was asked (vacate the property or paid the rent) the landlord may file an unlawful detainer.</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div> \r\n                                                    </div>  \r\n                                                </div>                             \r\n                                            </div>"], "url": "https://www.mono.courts.ca.gov/divisions/civil-unlawfuldetainer.htm"},

This cherished right is guaranteed by both the United States and California Constitutions. You may be summoned to render an important service as a juror. You have enjoyed the privileges of citizenship and the protection of your liberties and property through our system of self-government. Therefore, for a short time, you may be summoned to serve as a juror, an officer of the court, along with the attorneys and the judge. As a juror, you will be an important member of the judicial system of Mono County and California.\n\n</p><h2>How Jurors Are Summoned</h2>\n\n<p>The selection and management of jurors is governed by the California Code of Civil Procedure. Jurors' names are selected at random from lists of Mono County registered voters and persons who have valid California drivers licenses or identification cards issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles with a Mono County address. The two lists are combined to create one Master Jury List. For each jury trial, approximately 200 prospective jurors are randomly selected from the master list to receive a summons. The summonses are mailed approximately two weeks prior to the service date. The summons contains information and instructions on how to have jury service postponed; how to request to be excused from jury service; or how to notify the court of disqualification from jury service.</p>\n\n<p>If you have been summoned for jury duty, READ the summons carefully and follow its instructions, as it contains important information along with the name and address of the court, and date and time of your jury service.</p>\n\n<h2>Term of Service</h2>\n\n<p>The Mono County Superior Court operates on a <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/onedayonetrial.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">One Trial/One Day system</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In order to avoid unnecessary inconvenience to the juror, a call-in process is used. This means a juror is instructed to telephone the court at (800) 451-3585 the day before he/she is summoned to appear for reporting instructions. The juror may be instructed to report as summoned, to report on another day, or may be released from service because the trial to which he/she has been summoned was settled or canceled.</p>\n\n<p>Once instructed to report, a juror may or may not be selected to serve as a juror in a trial court. The Deputy Jury Commissioner is required to have a sufficient number of jurors for all anticipated trials. The jury staff tries to carefully estimate the number of jurors needed, but there are many variables outside their control.</p>\n\n<p>If a prospective juror is selected to serve on a trial as a sworn juror, the term of service will be the length of that trial. Trials vary in length, but generally last 2-5 days.</p>\n\n<p>Once the jury for the trial to which you have been summoned is selected, the judge will excuse all remaining prospective jurors and your jury service is complete. Approximately 80% of our prospective jurors complete their service in one day.</p>\n\n<h2>Pay Policy</h2>\n\n<p>State law does not currently require employers to continue paying the salary of employees while they are serving as jurors. However, many employers including state, federal, and local government agencies, have a policy which compensates employees for at least part, if not all the time spent for jury service. Before coming to court, the juror should talk with his or her employer.</p>\n\n<p>Jurors are paid the amount mandated by the State Legislature: $15.00 per day for each day of service after the first day and 34 cents per mile, one way only, also for each day of service after the first day. There is no pay or mileage for the first day of service. \"Service\" is defined as physically reporting to the court. Juror payroll is processed following the conclusion of each trial.</p>\n\n<h2>What If A Juror Does Not Report as Instructed</h2>\n\n<p>Every resident of Mono County who is qualified to serve and who does not have a legal hardship or excuse must appear for jury service when summoned. Willful failure to appear is contempt of court. Contempt of court is punished by fine of up to $1000.00 and/or five days in the county jail.</p>\n\n<h2>Employer Responsibilities</h2>\n\n<p>Employers cannot discriminate against employees serving on jury duty. Employers must allow employees time off to serve on a jury. The <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=230.&amp;lawCode=LAB\" target=\"_blank\">California Labor Code, section 230</a>, prohibits any employer from firing or harassing an employee who is summoned to court for jury service as long as reasonable notice is given.

The Court appoints citizens to the Grand Jury, formally charges its members with duties and responsibilities established by law, and guides the Grand Jury during its term.\n\n</p><p>Grand Jurors are officers of the Court but work as an independent body.
