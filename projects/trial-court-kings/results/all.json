The State, as the protector of all the people, makes the charge against someone accused of committing a crime because a crime is considered an act against society. Only the State, through the office of the District Attorney in each county, can charge individuals with criminal violations. The prosecuting attorney presents the charge against the accused person (defendant) on behalf of the State (plaintiff), and must prove to the judge or jury that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n\n<p>California statutes generally classify a crime as either a felony or a misdemeanor. A felony is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment in a state prison or by death. A misdemeanor is a lesser offense than a felony and generally is punishable by fine or imprisonment in county jail rather than in a state penitentiary.</p>\n\n<p>If you are the victim of a crime, there are resources available to you. Please contact the District Attorney\u2019s Office at be (559) 582-0236 or Victim Witness Assistance at (559) 852-2640.</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div><!-- Start Accordion Module (+ and - icons) -->\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n        <h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n        <div class=\"accordion-wrapper\">\n            \n            <div class=\"controls\">\n                <a class=\"expandall\" href=\"#\">expand all</a> <a class=\"collapseall\" href=\"#\">collapse all</a> \n            </div>\n            <br>\n            <div class=\"panel-group\" role=\"tablist\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\" id=\"bs-accordion\">\n                <div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        <!-- Start Accordion Item -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"panelacc643\">\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"panel-title\">\r\n        <a aria-controls=\"acc643\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" href=\"#acc643\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-parent=\"#accordion\">\r\n            Do I have to go to court?\r\n        </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" id=\"acc643\" aria-labelledby=\"panelacc643\">\r\n    <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>You have\u00a0 to go to court on your scheduled court date in almost all cases.

The trial will be held within 30 days if the defendant is in custody or within 45 days if the defendant is not in custody-unless the defendant waives the right to a speedy trial.\u00a0<br>\n<br>\nA misdemeanor is punishable by imprisonment in the county jail, Informal Probation and/or by fine.</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Accordon Item --><!-- Start Accordion Item -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"panelacc632\">\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"panel-title\">\r\n        <a aria-controls=\"acc632\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" href=\"#acc632\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-parent=\"#accordion\">\r\n            What are the different sentences the Judge could impose?\r\n        </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" id=\"acc632\" aria-labelledby=\"panelacc632\">\r\n    <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>State and local laws define crimes and specify punishment.

You may not appeal on behalf of a friend, a\u00a0 spouse, a child, or another relative unless you are a legally appointed representative\u00a0 for that person (such as a guardian or conservator).</p>\n\n<p class=\"topbottomBorders\"><strong>Do I need a lawyer to file an appeal?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Not\u00a0 generally. But appeals are very complicated, and take a lot of time, effort and\u00a0 money. You have to do all the paperwork correctly, meet the deadlines, and\u00a0 follow all the court's rules and procedures. If you make mistakes, your case\u00a0 may be dismissed and you may have to pay the appeal costs of the other side.</p>\n\n<p>Also, a lawyer can help you decide if you can or should file an appeal. A\u00a0 lawyer might know how to get what you want faster and cheaper by using a\u00a0 different legal process. Many lawyers do not do appeals, so make sure you talk\u00a0 to a lawyer who specializes in appeals. A lawyer who has done some appeals and\u00a0 knows how to handle them will know what to do when, and can guide your case\u00a0 through the appeal process.</p>\n\n<p>You can proceed with your appeal on your own, but given the particular nature\u00a0 of your case, you may want to consult with a lawyer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"topbottomBorders\"><strong>How much does it cost to file an appeal?</strong></p>\n\n<p>For fees relating to civil appeals, please see the current fee schedule for Kings County Superior Court, which can be found <a class=\"underline\" href=\"/forms/index.htm\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"redFont\">If you are low-income, you may be able to qualify for a fee waiver and not have to pay a filing fee. Fee Waiver forms and information can be found <a class=\"underline\" href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-feewaiver.htm\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"topbottomBorders\"><strong>Which court hears civil appeals?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Appeals of\u00a0 limited civil cases (civil cases in which the amount claimed is $25,000 or\u00a0 less), are heard in the appellate division of the superior court.</p>\n\n<p>Appeals of unlimited civil cases (civil cases in which the amount claimed is\u00a0 over $25,000), are heard in the Fifth Appellate District. You can find contact\u00a0 and other information for the Courts of Appeal at <a class=\"underline\" href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/5dca.htm\">Courts of\u00a0 Appeal</a>. The Fifth District Court of Appeal is located in Fresno,\u00a0California.</p>\n\n<p class=\"topbottomBorders\"><strong>What types of civil cases does the Court of Appeal deal with?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Courts of Appeal handle appeals in unlimited civil\u00a0 cases (civil cases in which the amount claimed is over $25,000). Courts of\u00a0 Appeal also decide certain cases that do not get filed at the superior court\u00a0 and instead must be filed at the court of appeal, like petitions such as\u00a0 mandamus, prohibition and certiorari in unlimited civil cases.</p>\n\n<p>There are six appellate districts, each with a Court\u00a0 of Appeal.

You may also ask for an interpreter printing the <a class=\"underline\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/documents/kings/InterpreterRequest.docx\">Interpreter Request Form</a> and bringing it into our Clerk's Office, or fill out and email this form using the email address found on the form. It is important to notify the court as soon as possible if an interpreter is needed. If you wait until your court date, you may have to wait until an interpreter can be contacted. If an interpreter is not available at the time of your hearing, your case may be continued until an interpreter can be assigned.\n\n</p><p><strong>What if I need an interpreter, but the court does not provide one?</strong><br>\nThe court will not provide you with an interpreter except in the case types listed above. If you need an interpreter to help you understand what is said during one of these court proceedings, you must bring a certified, registered or provisionally qualified interpreter to interpret for you. You may not bring anyone under the age of 18 to interpret for you. For a list of qualified interpreters, please check the Judicial Council website, <a class=\"underline\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/3796.htm\">Search for an Interpreter</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What if I need a sign language interpreter?</strong><br>\nThe court will provide you with a sign language interpreter for any court hearing you may have. The court will also provide you with a sign language interpreter if you are called for jury duty. Please tell a clerk at the counter or in the courtroom as soon as possible if you will need a sign language interpreter. For more information on this and other Access and Accommodation needs please visit the <a class=\"underline\" href=\"/generalinfo/ada.htm\">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</a> page on this site.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are you interested in becoming a Court Interpreter?</strong><br>\nDue to the limited resources of certified/registered interpreters statewide, the court may sometimes provide a provisionally qualified interpreter (non-certified, non-registered for the mandated areas listed above). As a court interpreter, you will play a key role in our trial courts by interpreting for defendants, litigants and witnesses thereby helping to insure access to the Limited English Proficiency (LEP) customers. For more information on how to become a court interpreter please visit the Judicial Council website, <a class=\"underline\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/7996.htm\">Interpreter Program</a>. Or contact the Interpreter Coordinator at <span class=\"iconPhone\">(559) 582-1010 x6225</span>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any other language services you provide to Limited English Proficiency court users?</strong><br>\nThe Kings Superior Court understands that without proper language assistance, Limited English Proficiency (LEP) court users may be excluded from meaningful participation in the judicial process. The Courts are always searching for new solutions for these issues including more efficient use of existing resources to help improve and expand language access around the state. To get more information on efficiencies that Kings Superior Court has implemented to enhance language access for all LEP court users you may read our <a class=\"underline\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/documents/kings/LEP.pdf\">Limited English Proficiency (LEP) Plan</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For information on the Judicial Council, <a class=\"underline\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/jc-20150122-itemK.pdf\">\"Strategic Plan for Language Access in the California Courts.\"</a></p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div> \r\n                                                    </div>  \r\n                                                </div>                             \r\n                                            </div>"], "_type": "page", "_template": "b9c4-465b-a9a3", "title": ["Interpreter Services"], "aside": ["<div class=\"contentFloat col-xs-4\" id=\"floatRight\">\r\n                                                <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                                    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n                                                                                                                \r\n                                                         \r\n \r\n\r\n                <h3 class=\"bottomOnly\">Contact Information</h3>\r\n            \r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/generalinfo/contact-location.htm\"><strong>Hanford</strong></a>:<br>\n1640 Kings County Drive<br>\nHanford, CA 93230\n\n</p><p><span class=\"iconPhone\"><span class=\"iconPhoneLeft\"><strong>Phone:</strong>\u00a0(559) 582-1010\u00a0x6225</span></span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Monday - Friday: </strong><br>\n8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.\u00a0</p>\r\n<div class=\"row\" id=\"hrBorderSub\"><!-- fill line --></div><div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n                        <h3 class=\"bottomOnly\">Related Links</h3>\r\n                            \r\n         \r\n        <p></p><ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"/generalinfo/contact-location.htm\">Contact\u00a0&amp; Location</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/1095.htm\">Cal Courts Interpreters</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"/documents/kings/Language-Access-Complaint-Form.pdf\">Language Access Complaint Form</a></li>\n</ul>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div><div class=\"row\" id=\"hrBorderSub\"><!-- fill line --></div>\r\n                                                    </div>\r\n                                                </div>\r\n                                            </div>"]},

The clerk will charge a fee of $15.00 for this service. You should check back with the court prior to the hearing to see if the receipt for certified mail was returned to the court. Service by certified mail can only be accomplished by the Clerk of the Court.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"square2\">\n\t<li>The person who completes service as stated above must complete the Proof of Service form, <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc104.pdf\">Judicial Council Form SC-104</a>, and have it filed with the Court.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>PROOF OF SERVICE MUST BE FILED WITH THE COURT FIVE (5) DAYS PRIOR TO THE HEARING DATE.\u00a0 If there is no proof of service on file the matter may be continued or will be automatically dropped from the Court\u2019s calendar.\u00a0 The Plaintiff must then request the matter be reset.</strong></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>YOU CANNOT SERVE PAPERS ON THE DEFENDANT YOURSELF.

Small claims court is informal, so you do not have to know the law; however it will improve your chances for success if you can distill the essential elements of the case and present them to the court in a clear and concise manner.</p>\n\n<p>The opposing side is entitled to see all evidence before it is submitted to the court; therefore, if you plan to bring documents to show the court, you need to make extra copies for the other side, and for the judge. It will save time if you can each have a copy to refer to in court.</p>\n\n<p>Be sure you are on time for the trial. Although the small claims trial is informal, you must be prepared with witnesses, books, receipts and other documents needed to prove your case. If your witnesses are not willing to come to court voluntarily, you can request that the court clerk issue a\u00a0<strong>subpoena</strong>. A subpoena is a court order that requires the witness to appear. The witness has a right to charge a fee for appearing. If you do not have in your possession the records or papers necessary to prove your case, you may request the court clerk issue a<strong>subpoena</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong><em><strong>duces tecum</strong></em><strong>\u00a0</strong>in advance of the trial date, which orders the documents you are requesting be delivered to court for trial.</p>\n\n<p>Many cases are scheduled for the same time, so each case is given limited time. You should describe the events clearly and concisely. Before you present to the court any photographs, diagrams or documents, you must first show them to the opposing side. If possible, observe other small claims proceedings in the same department or courtroom where your case is scheduled, prior to the day you are to appear. You will get an idea how to proceed in an organized manner due to the limited time available for each case.</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Accordon Item --><!-- Start Accordion Item -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"panelacc695\">\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"panel-title\">\r\n        <a aria-controls=\"acc695\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" href=\"#acc695\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-parent=\"#accordion\">\r\n            Where do I get the forms to file a claim?\r\n        </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" id=\"acc695\" aria-labelledby=\"panelacc695\">\r\n    <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>You can complete forms online for free at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm\">www.courts.ca.gov/forms.html</a></p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Accordon Item -->\n                    \n                    <div class=\"clear25\"></div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<!-- End Accordion Module (+ and - icons) --> \r\n                                                    </div>  \r\n                                                </div>                             \r\n                                            </div>"], "_type": "page", "links_href": ["http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-smallclaims.htm", "http://www.courts.ca.gov/1014.htm", "http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/small_claims/index.shtml", "http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/landlordbook/index.shtml"], "links_title": ["California Courts: Small Claims", "California Courts: Judgment Collection", "California Department of Consumer Affairs\u2019 Small Claims Court Guide", "California Department of Consumer Affairs\u2019 California Tenants Guide"], "_template": "b9c4-465b-a9a3", "aside": ["<div class=\"contentFloat col-xs-4\" id=\"floatRight\">\r\n                                                <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                                    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n                                                                                                                \r\n                                                         \r\n \r\n\r\n                <h3 class=\"bottomOnly\">Contact Information</h3>\r\n            \r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/generalinfo/contact-location.htm\"><strong>Hanford</strong></a>:<br>\n1640 Kings County Drive<br>\nHanford, CA 93230\n\n</p><p><span class=\"iconPhone\"><span class=\"iconPhoneLeft\"><strong>Phone:</strong>\u00a0(559) 582-1010\u00a0</span></span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Monday - Friday: </strong><br>\n8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p></p>\r\n<div class=\"row\" id=\"hrBorderSub\"><!-- fill line --></div>\r\n                                                    </div>\r\n                                                </div>\r\n                                            </div>"]},

The first is \"irreconcilable differences\", meaning that at least one party asserts that the marriage cannot be saved. The other reason is \"incurable insanity\" which, unlike irreconcilable differences, must be proven.\n\n</p><h4>Dissolution of Marriage (Divorce):</h4>\n\n<p>A dissolution of marriage, which is more commonly known as divorce, terminates the marriage and resolves marital issues including child custody, visitation, child support, spousal support, asset and debt division (real and personal property), former name restoration, restraining orders, and other issues identified by the parties. You must wait 6 months from the date the respondent was served with the divorce documents. You will then have to submit judgment paperwork to the court for a Judge\u2019s signature before you are legally divorced. For current filing fees <a class=\"underline\" href=\"/forms/index.htm\">click here</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>Summary Dissolution:</h4>\n\n<p>If you and your spouse are in agreement that you want to divorce you may be able to obtain a summary dissolution. The criteria for a summary dissolution include:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"square2\">\n\t<li>You were married for under five years,</li>\n\t<li>There were no children born during the marriage,</li>\n\t<li>You have very few community assets and debts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h4>Legal Separation:</h4>\n\n<p>Legal separation is similar to dissolution of marriage, except that the parties remain married to each other. The court may make orders regarding the same issues identified in a dissolution of marriage.\u00a0<br>\n<br>\nIf you open a legal separation action, you may amend your petition prior to judgment to request a dissolution of marriage. That will allow you to \"start the clock\" on the waiting period for divorce (six months from date of service), provided that you follow some special instructions.</p>\n\n<h4>Nullity:</h4>\n\n<p>A nullity is more commonly known as an annulment of marriage. This may only be requested if a party alleges incest, bigamy, minor without parental consent, unsound mind, fraud, force or incapacity to consummate marriage.</p>\n\n<h4>Domestic Partnerships:</h4>\n\n<p>Dissolution of a domestic partnership terminates the partnership. You must be a resident of the state of California, both parties do not have to agree to the dissolution and it takes a minimum of six months for this action to become final.</p>\n\n<h4>Child and Spousal Support:</h4>\n\n<p>To obtain or modify family support orders, establish parentage, or enforce existing family support orders, the Department of Child Support Services is available to assist you. Information concerning this office is available at the\u00a0<a class=\"underline\" href=\"http://www.childsup.ca.gov/\">California Department of Child Support Services website</a>\u00a0or by telephone, 1-866-901-3212.</p>\n\n<h4>Adoptions: Private and Stepparent:</h4>\n\n<p>Before granting a petition for adoption, the court authorizes an investigation of the adoptive parents(s), regardless of whether they are related to the children or stepparents. Parties are required to pay for these investigations. Typically, the court will also consider petitions to terminate parental rights of the parent(s) who are relinquishing their children in this process.</p>\n\n<p>View the <a href=\"/documents/kings/IAP-FactSheet.pdf\">Independent Adoption Program (IAP) Fact Sheet</a> for further information regarding independent adoptions.</p>\n\n<h4>Domestic Violence:</h4>\n\n<p>Parties alleging domestic violence may file for a Domestic Violence Restraining Order.</p>\n\n<h4>Establishment of Parental Relationship:</h4>\n\n<p>These are also called \"paternity cases\". The court may make findings or parental relationship in these matters that will have an effect on child support, visitation and custody.</p>\n\n<h4>Child Custody, Support and Visitation:</h4>\n\n<p>Even after marital and domestic partnership issues have been resolved, the court retains jurisdiction over issues that affect minor children in these proceedings until these children reach 18 years of age (or 19 years of age if still in high school). Parties may file motions to modify custody, support and visitation any time the circumstances warrant such filings.</p>\n\n<h4>Emancipation of Minors:</h4>\n\n<p>A minor may petition the court for a declaration of emancipation if the minor is at least 14 years of age, willingly lives separately from parents, and managing his own personal financial affairs.</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div> \r\n                                                    </div>  \r\n                                                </div>                             \r\n                                            </div>"], "_type": "page", "links_href": ["http://www.courts.ca.gov/7646.htm", "https://www.kings.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp/index.htm", "https://www.kings.courts.ca.gov/forms/index.htm", "https://www.kings.courts.ca.gov/generalinfo/localrules.htm", "https://www.kings.courts.ca.gov/generalinfo/contact-location.htm", "https://www.kings.courts.ca.gov/divisions/smallclaims.htm", "http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-feewaiver.htm", "http://www.courts.ca.gov/1062.htm", "http://www.courts.ca.gov/1065.htm", "https://www.kings.courts.ca.gov/documents/kings/Mediators-for-Kings-County.pdf", "http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp.htm", "http://courts.ca.gov/selfhelp.htm?rdeLocaleAttr=es"], "links_title": ["Fee Schedule", "Family Law Facilitator", "Local Forms", "Local Rules", "Location, Hours & Contacts", "Small Claims", "Fee Waivers", "Limited Civil Cases", "Unlimited Civil Cases", "Mediators for Kings County"], "_template": "b9c4-465b-a9a3", "aside": ["<div class=\"contentFloat col-xs-4\" id=\"floatRight\">\r\n                                                <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                                    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n                                                                                                                \r\n                                                         \r\n \r\n\r\n                <h3 class=\"bottomOnly\">Contact Information</h3>\r\n            \r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/generalinfo/contact-location.htm\"><strong>Hanford</strong></a>:<br>\n1640 Kings County Drive<br>\nHanford, CA 93230\n\n</p><p><span class=\"iconPhone\"><span class=\"iconPhoneLeft\"><strong>Phone:</strong>\u00a0(559) 582-1010\u00a0x6023</span></span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Monday - Friday: </strong><br>\n8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.</p>\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n                        <h3 class=\"bottomOnly\">Frequently Used Forms</h3>\r\n                            \r\n         \r\n        <p><strong>Need a court date?</strong><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl300.pdf\">Fill out form FL-300</a>\n\n</p><p><strong>Need to modify child custody and/or visitation orders?</strong><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl300.pdf\">Fill out form FL-300</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Need a Telephonic Appearance for a Department of Child Support Hearing?</strong><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl679.pdf\">Fill out form LF-679</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl679info.pdf\">Instructions - FL679INFO</a></p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div><div class=\"row\" id=\"hrBorderSub\"><!-- fill line --></div>\r\n                                                    </div>\r\n                                                </div>\r\n                                            </div>"]},

Punishment for infractions result in an imposition of fines only and do not carry any type of jail time. Failure to pay traffic fines when due or respond to a citation by the Appear by Date can lead to additional penalties including the imposition of a civil assessment fee and a DMV hold placed on your driver\u2019s license.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Contact information:<br>\nSuperior Court of Kings County, Traffic Division<br>\n1640 Kings County Drive<br>\nHanford, Ca. 93230<br>\n559.582.1010 option 1</strong></p>\n\n<p>NOTE: When contacting the Clerk's Office for information about traffic citations, please have your citation number ready.

You can obtain the subpoena form from the Clerk's Office (Traffic Division). Do this well in advance of your Traffic Trial date. Complete the subpoena form, have the subpoena served, and file the subpoena and the proof of service with the Court on or before your Traffic Trial date.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h3>What happens when I go to Court?</h3>\n\n<p>Report directly to the Department in which your Traffic Trial has been scheduled. The Bailiff or Clerk will give some preliminary instructions and then check in those people appearing in Court. A Judicial Officer will then hear the case. The Court will listen to the statements of the sworn Officer and witnesses against you and may question each witness. You may then present your case to the Court. The Court will then rule on the matter or take the matter under submission. If the Court takes the matter under submission, you will be notified by mail of the Court's ruling and, if found guilty, you will be informed of the sentence imposed.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h3>What if I am found not guilty?</h3>\n\n<p>If you are found not guilty, any bail deposit will be returned by mail within 60 days.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h3>What if I do not appear at the time of the Traffic Trial?</h3>\n\n<p>Your Traffic Trial can be heard without you present (in abstention). You can be found guilty, and any bail will be forfeited. If your bail is forfeited, your driving record will show a conviction, OR the Court may take the Traffic Trial off calendar due to your failure to appear and issue a bench warrant for your arrest.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h3>Will the Officer who issued the citation be in Court?</h3>\n\n<p>The Officer will be subpoenaed to appear for all Traffic Trial settings.</p>\n\n<p></p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Accordon Item -->\n                    \n                    <div class=\"clear25\"></div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<!-- End Accordion Module (+ and - icons) --> \r\n                                                    </div>  \r\n                                                </div>                             \r\n                                            </div>"], "_type": "page", "_template": "c97e-4b53-92a6", "title": ["Traffic"]},

Unless otherwise ordered, each parent shall pay 50% ($100.00 per parent) of the cost of the Review fees before their appointment.</p>\n\n<h4>Who should I bring to attend the Child Custody Recommending Counseling session?</h4>\n\n<p>Do not bring your child(ren), friends, relative, spouse, significant others\u2026 with you to the appointment. Child Custody Recommending Counseling is just for the parents. Only parents to the case may go to Family Court Services except for certain situations when there is a Domestic Violence Restraining or Criminal Proactive Order. The parents can have a silent support person with them in session.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h4>If the children don\u2019t go to Child Custody Recommending Counseling, how will the child(ren)\u2019s wishes and needs be considered?</h4>\n\n<p>Their wishes and needs will be considered by you, the other parent(s) and the Child Custody Recommending Counselor (CCRC). The parents are the people who know your child(ren) best, and they are the best people to determine what your child(ren)\u2019s living arrangements should be. As you work with the CCRC, the CCRC will help you understand the choices available to parents, arrangements that often work well for children your child(ren)\u2019s ages, what children need as their parents are separating, and how parents can best meet these needs. The CCRC will help you and the other parent address your parenting concerns and focus on what you each parent believes is best for the child(ren).</p>\n\n<h4>My child wants to talk with the judge or the CCRC. Should I bring them to court for the hearing?</h4>\n\n<p>No. If you believe your child(ren) wishes to speak with the judge, then explain that in your court paperwork or to the Child Custody Recommending Counselor. Do not bring your child(ren) to court or to CCRC unless a judge or a commissioner specifically tells you, or the CCRC has requested that you bring them to Family Court Services for a minor interview appointment. There is a $200.00 Minor Interview fee to interview the child(ren) in Family Law Cases.\u00a0 Unless otherwise ordered, each parent shall pay 50% ($100.00 per parent) of the cost for of the Minor Interview fees before the Minor Interview Appointment.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h4>What if the other parent doesn\u2019t go to the CCRC appointment that was given to us in court?</h4>\n\n<p>Keep your court date. When you return to court, then the judge/commissioner will decide what should happen next.</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div><div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n                        <h3 class=\"doubleBars\">ADDITIONAL RESOURCES REGARDING CUSTODY AND PARENTING SERVICES</h3>\r\n                            \r\n         \r\n        <p>For further information, including a free parent education course, and additional resources to help families understand the divorce and separation process, please see these links:<br>\n<br>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.parenting.familieschange.ca.gov\">www.parenting.familieschange.ca.gov</a><br>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.familieschange.ca.gov\">www.familieschange.ca.gov</a><br>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.changeville.ca.gov\">www.changeville.ca.gov</a></p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div> \r\n                                                    </div>  \r\n                                                </div>                             \r\n                                            </div>"], "_type": "page", "links_href": ["http://www.courts.ca.gov/7646.htm", "https://www.kings.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp/index.htm", "https://www.kings.courts.ca.gov/forms/index.htm", "https://www.kings.courts.ca.gov/generalinfo/localrules.htm", "https://www.kings.courts.ca.gov/generalinfo/contact-location.htm", "https://www.kings.courts.ca.gov/divisions/smallclaims.htm", "http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-feewaiver.htm", "http://www.courts.ca.gov/1062.htm", "http://www.courts.ca.gov/1065.htm", "https://www.kings.courts.ca.gov/documents/kings/Mediators-for-Kings-County.pdf"], "links_title": ["Fee Schedule", "Family Law Facilitator", "Local Forms", "Local Rules", "Location, Hours & Contacts", "Small Claims", "Fee Waivers", "Limited Civil Cases", "Unlimited Civil Cases", "Mediators for Kings County"], "_template": "b9c4-465b-a9a3", "aside": ["<div class=\"contentFloat col-xs-4\" id=\"floatRight\">\r\n                                                <div class=\"row\">\r\n                                                    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n                                                                                                                \r\n                                                         \r\n \r\n\r\n                <h3 class=\"bottomOnly\">Contact Information</h3>\r\n            \r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/generalinfo/contact-location.htm\"><strong>Hanford</strong></a>:<br>\n1640 Kings County Drive<br>\nHanford, CA 93230\n\n</p><p><span class=\"iconPhone\"><span class=\"iconPhoneLeft\"><strong>Phone:</strong>\u00a0(559) 582-1010\u00a0</span></span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Monday - Friday: </strong><br>\n8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.\u00a0</p>\r\n<div class=\"row\" id=\"hrBorderSub\"><!-- fill line --></div><div class=\"clear15\"></div><!-- Start Image Block -->\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n        \n\n        \n                        <p><a href=\"http://www.familieschange.ca.gov/\"><img src=\"/images/kings/familieschange.jpg\" alt=\"Families Change Button\"></a></p>\n                      \n        <div class=\"clear5\"></div>        \n    </div>    \n</div>\n<!-- End Image-Text Block -->\r\n                                                    </div>\r\n                                                </div>\r\n                                            </div>"]},

When this happens, the judge and the parties may need to address the matter outside of your presence. You should not speculate about what is going on. Rest assured that the judge respects your time and will make every effort not to waste it.</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div><div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n                        <h3 class=\"bottomOnly\">Challenges</h3>\r\n                            \r\n         \r\n        <p>An attorney may \"challenge you for cause.\" This means the attorney will ask the judge to excuse you from the jury for a specific legal reason.

That is, the attorney may ask that you be excused without giving any reason at all. If this happens, do not take it personally. The lawyer is merely exercising a right given by law. If you are excused for any reason, return to the jury assembly room for further instruction.\n\n</p><p>After the required number of jurors has been chosen, the jury panel is sworn to try the case.</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div> \r\n                                                    </div>  \r\n                                                </div>                             \r\n                                            </div>"], "_type": "page", "_template": "c97e-4b53-92a6", "title": ["Reporting Instructions"]},
