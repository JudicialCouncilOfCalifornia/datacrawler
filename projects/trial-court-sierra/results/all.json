If a participant is non-compliant, a series of sanctions may be imposed that range from essay writing, community service and flash incarcerations to expulsion from the program.

These are important decisions. The Court has a goal of making sure children spend time with both parents, are supported by both parents, and have a plan that is in their best interest.\n\n</p><p>California law states that when parents cannot reach an agreement, they must first meet with a professional mediator before they can got to court. Family Court Services provides mediation for separated or divorced parents involved in disputes over custody and visitation of children in cases where the Sierra County Superior Court has jurisdiction.</p>\n\n<p>Mediation is a cooperative problem solving process between the parties, with the assistance of a trained mediator. Mediation is confidential. One of the most important benefits of mediation is that an agreement reached in mediation is more likely to be honored by the parties and reduces the likelihood of litigation in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Contact the <a href=\"https://www.sierra.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp/facilitator.htm\"><u>Family Law Facilitator</u></a> or the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/1189.htm\"><u>California Courts website</u></a> for more information.\u00a0</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div><!-- Start Accordion Module (+ and - icons) -->\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n        <h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Family Law Topics</h3>\n        <div class=\"accordion-wrapper\">\n            \n            <div class=\"controls\">\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"expandall\">expand all</a> <a href=\"#\" class=\"collapseall\">collapse all</a> \n            </div>\n            <br>\n            <div role=\"tablist\" class=\"panel-group\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\" id=\"bs-accordion\">\n                <div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        <!-- Start Accordion Item -->\r\n\r\n<div role=\"tab\" class=\"panel-heading\" id=\"panelacc3838\">\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"panel-title\">\r\n        <a href=\"#acc3838\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-controls=\"acc3838\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\r\n            Dissolution of Marriage (Divorce)\r\n        </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div aria-labelledby=\"panelacc3838\" role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" id=\"acc3838\">\r\n    <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: For dissolution of marriage or legal separation in California</strong>, there are only two legal grounds. The first is \"irreconcilable differences\", meaning that at least one party asserts that the marriage cannot be saved. The other reason is \"incurable insanity\" which, unlike irreconcilable differences, must be proven.\n\n</p><p><strong>Dissolution of Marriage (Divorce):</strong> A dissolution of marriage, which is more commonly known as divorce, terminates the marriage and resolves marital issues including child custody, visitation, child support, spousal support, asset and debt division (real and personal property), former name restoration, restraining orders, and other issues identified by the parties.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary Dissolution:</strong> If you and your spouse are in agreement that you want to divorce you may be able to obtain a summary dissolution. The criteria for a summary dissolution include:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"square2\">\n\t<li>You were married for under five years,</li>\n\t<li>There were no children born during the marriage,</li>\n\t<li>You have very few community assets and debts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For more information about this option, which is less complicated than a regular dissolution of marriage, visit the online self-help at the <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-summarydissolution.htm\">California Courts website</a>.</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Accordon Item --><!-- Start Accordion Item -->\r\n\r\n<div role=\"tab\" class=\"panel-heading\" id=\"panelacc3837\">\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"panel-title\">\r\n        <a href=\"#acc3837\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-controls=\"acc3837\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\r\n            Legal Separation\r\n        </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div aria-labelledby=\"panelacc3837\" role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" id=\"acc3837\">\r\n    <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>Legal separation is similar to dissolution of marriage, except that the parties remain married to each other.

If you cannot appear on the date on your summons, you may request a postponement by calling the Jury Commissioner during business hours at <span class=\"iconPhone\">(530) 289 - 2930</span>.\u00a0<br>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n\t<li><strong>How did we get your name?</strong><br>\n\tWe obtain names from the Department of Motor Vehicles and the Registrar of Voters. If the information you provide to these two sources is not identical you may receive two summonses. If the information at the Department of Motor Vehicles or the Registrar of Voters is not up to date you may receive additional summonses.\u00a0 If you receive more than one summons, please contact the Jury Commissioner to correct your records.<br>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n\t<li><strong>I received a jury summons for someone who is deceased or no longer lives at this address, what should I do with the summons?</strong><br>\n\tState on the front of the unopened summons \"this person is no longer at this address\" or \u201cthis person is deceased\u201d and place the summons back in the mail. The Department of Motor Vehicles and Registrar of Voters is our source of information. You should notify these two sources to avoid receiving any further jury summons at your address.<br>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n\t<li><strong>Can I be excused for medical, mental or physical disability reasons?</strong><br>\n\tYes. A juror who is <strong>under 70</strong> years of age must provide a physician's verification note on a prescription pad or letterhead signed by a doctor. The note must state that the juror cannot serve on jury duty for medical reasons and should indicate the length or duration of the illness or problem. If the condition is permanent or long term, the physician must also include that information in his/her statement. Obtaining a copy of your doctor's letter for your personal file is advised. A juror who is <strong>over 70</strong> years of age must provide a statement in writing that he or she cannot serve on jury duty for medical reasons and should state the length or duration of the illness or problem, and if the condition is permanent or long term.<br>\n\t<br>\n\t<a href=\"/generalinfo/jury_excuse-deferral.htm\"><u>More Information and Sample Letter</u></a><br>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n\t<li><strong>Are Correctional Officer's exempt from jury service?</strong><br>\n\tOnly peace officers whose positions are defined under Penal Code sections 830.1 and 830.2(a) are exempt from jury service.<br>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n\t<li><strong>Are stay-at-home parents excused from jury service?</strong><br>\n\tNo. Neither stay-at-home parents nor childcare providers are exempt or excused from jury service. Children are not allowed in the courtrooms. Alternative arrangements will need to be made. Refer to <a href=\"/generalinfo/jury_excuse-deferral.htm\"><u>Excuse and Deferral</u></a> if additional time is needed to arrange for childcare.<br>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n\t<li><strong>Are individuals over 70 years of age exempt from jury service?</strong><br>\n\tNo. However, if you are over the age of 70 and have medical issues which prevent you from serving, you should fill out your Jury Questionnaire, listing your age and state the reason you cannot serve (see question 4 above).<br>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n\t<li><strong>How often can I be summoned?</strong><br>\n\tEffective January 3, 2000, prospective jurors may be summoned once a year. Your term of service is One Day or One Trial. Jurors report in person one day, and may be selected to serve on a case of any length. Once your jury duty is completed, you will not be asked to serve for one year. If you receive more than one summons during the year, you may be in our database more than once. This often occurs if information received from the Department of Motor Vehicles and the Registrar of Voters are not the same. Hyphenated names, maiden and married names and names containing a space can cause duplication within the database. If you receive a summons earlier than expected, notify the jury office in writing so we may correct the error and update our database.</li>\n</ol>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div> \r\n                                                    </div>  \r\n                                                </div>                             \r\n                                            </div>"], "_type": "page", "url": "https://www.sierra.courts.ca.gov/generalinfo/jury_faqs.htm"},

Jurors report in person one day, and may be selected to serve on a case of any length. In rare instances, jury selection for a case will take longer than one day.
