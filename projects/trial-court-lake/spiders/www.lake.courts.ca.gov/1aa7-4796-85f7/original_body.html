            <p><strong>General Information</strong>

<p>If you received a ticket or a traffic citation, you may receive a Courtesy Notice from the court in the mail. If this is your first contact with the Traffic Court process, most of your questions will be answered by information provided on the Courtesy Notice.</p>

<p>The "bail" on a traffic ticket is the amount of money required to guarantee your appearance. Your courtesy notice will show the amount required. If you choose to forfeit the bail on the citation, the violation is considered paid, and the resulting conviction will be placed on your driving record, if it is a reportable offense.</p></p>

<p>Proof of correction can be obtained by visiting a law enforcement agency or DMV, depending on the type of violation, and having an agent fill out the certificate of correction located on the reverse side of your citation. Please note that some agencies will charge a fee to sign off your citation.</p>

<p>If you were cited for expired vehicle registration, expired license or no license in possession, you may have a representative from the Department of Motor Vehicles fill out the certificate of correction.</p>

<p>Proof of insurance cannot be signed-off by a law enforcement officer or agent from the DMV. It must be sent directly to the court clerk. If you did not have insurance at the time of the violation, and have now purchased insurance, you may be eligible for a reduced fine. Please contact a court clerk for more information.</p>

<p>Proof of correction must be received by the court along with a fee of $25 for each correctible violation on or before the due date indicated on your courtesy notice.</p></p>

<p>Upon payment, you will be given 90 days to complete a DMV-approved or approved on-line traffic school and return proof of completion to the court. Extensions will not be granted. If you fail to submit proof by the due date, a conviction will be reported to the DMV and a point will be added to your driving record. The school will charge a fee that is in addition to the amount paid to the court. Please contact a Lake County approved traffic school for times and locations of classes. To find a DMV licensed Internet, Home Study or Classroom traffic violator school acceptable by the court, simply search the <a class="iconArrow2Right" href="http://www.dmv.ca.gov/olinq2/welcome.do">DMV’s Traffic School Provider look-up system</a>. If you are a minor or are cited with a misdemeanor you must appear in court. At the hearing you may request traffic school. The judge will determine whether or not you may attend.</p>

<p>Holders of commercial drivers licenses are prohibited from attending traffic school, pursuant to Vehicle Code Section 42005, even if they were driving a non-commercial vehicle at the time of the violation.</p>

<p>You are also not eligible for traffic school if you are charged with an alcohol or drug-related offense. You are not eligible for traffic school if you are charged with a two-point violation.</p>

<p>For more information, you may call the court and speak with a clerk at 707-994-6598.</p></p>

	<li><strong>When traffic bail is not required:</strong>

	<p>You have the right to appear in court for arraignment to contest the alleged traffic infraction without prior deposit of bail. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.105.) If you choose NOT to post bail under the options described under #2, below, you must appear as instructed on the citation, even if you do not receive a courtesy notice. When you appear for an arraignment hearing, you will enter a plea. If you plead not guilty at arraignment, you may ask for a court trial on a separate date.</p>

	<p>The court may require payment of bail at arraignment before trial if:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>you do not sign a promise to appear as ordered by the court, or</li>
		<li>the court finds (and states the reasons for the findings) that, based on the circumstances of your particular case, you are unlikely to appear without a deposit of bail.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.105(c).)</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>When traffic bail is required:</strong>
	<ol type="A">
		<li><em>Post (pay) and forfeit bail:</em><br />
		If you do not wish to challenge your traffic citation and there is no mandatory court appearance, you must pay the bail for noncorrectable violations and provide proof of correction and pay the fees for any correctable violations by the due date on the citation. The court will report a conviction for any noncorrectable violations to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).</li>
		<li><em>State your intention to plead not guilty and request a trial date:</em><br />
		If you want to plead not guilty and schedule a court trial, you may tell the court, in person or in writing, that you intend to plead not guilty. Your case will be set for an arraignment and trial date on the same day, unless you request arraignment and trial on separate days. To take advantage of this convenience, deposit of traffic bail is required. (See Vehicle Code section 40519(a).) If you are found not guilty at trial, your bail will be returned.</li>
		<li><em>Plead not guilty in writing and request a trial date:</em><br />
		If you want to plead not guilty in writing and schedule a court trial, you may do so by mail or in person with the clerk. Your case will be set for an arraignment and trial date on the same day, unless you request arraignment and trial on separate days. To take advantage of this convenience, deposit of traffic bail is required. (See Vehicle Code section 40519(b).) If you are found not guilty at trial, your bail will be returned.</li>
		<li><em>Trial by written declaration:</em><br />
		You may avoid all court appearances by choosing to have a trial by written declaration. This means that that instead of going to court to contest your case, you and the citing officer provide testimony and any evidence in writing. (See Vehicle Code section 40902.) You must post the bail amount to use this procedure. If you are found not guilty, your bail will be returned.</li>
