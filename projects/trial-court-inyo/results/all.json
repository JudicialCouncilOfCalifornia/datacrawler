Dependency matters are filed with the Court when there are reports that children have been abandoned, abused or neglected by their parent(s) or legal guardian. These cases are also filed with the Court when parents or legal guardians are unable or unwilling to care for their children.</p>\n\n<p>The objectives of Dependency Court are to:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Protect the health and safety of minor children;\u00a0</li>\n\t<li>Preserve families, whenever possible;\u00a0</li>\n\t<li>Provide placement of children with a relative, foster family, group home or an adoptive parent if it is determined to be in their best interest.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">JUVENILE DELINQUENCY</h3>\n\n<p>The Welfare and Institutions Code, starting at section 602, describes the Court's jurisdiction over misdemeanors and felonies committed by minors (persons under 18 years of age.) For certain serious crimes, the law currently provides the possibility of trying juveniles as adults in the Adult Criminal Court.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Parents or guardians have the right to receive a copy of the delinquency petition, stating the delinquent acts the child is accused of committing. The petition does not prove that the minor committed these acts and there will be opportunities at court hearings to present evidence regarding the minor's involvement in the alleged criminal acts.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>For those who cannot afford legal representation for their children, the Court will appoint an attorney. Please note that this attorney represents the child only and will not represent the parents or guardians.</p>\n\n<p>The objectives of the Delinquency Court are to:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Protect the minor;</li>\n\t<li>Give guidance to the minor;\u00a0</li>\n\t<li>Punish minors who commit delinquent acts, and;\u00a0</li>\n\t<li>Ensure the safety of the community.\u00a0</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>If a minor becomes a ward of the Delinquency Court, the Court will make orders for the parents or guardians and the minor. The minor may be allowed to live in the parents' or guardians' home under Court supervision or may be placed outside of the home in an unlocked or locked facility. The factors that the Court will consider in making this determination include the child's age, the seriousness of the offense, and the history of delinquency.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Transfer Information for Other Counties</h3>\n\n<p>Transfer-in hearings for <strong>dependency</strong> matters are held on the second and fourth Thursdays of each month (excluding holidays) at 9:00a.m. at the Bishop branch of the Superior Court, located at 301 West Line Street, Bishop, CA 93514.

Usually a demurrer is brought when the defendant does not believe the plaintiff has stated sufficient facts to support the legal theory, or cause of action, upon which the plaintiff\u2019s claim is based. Sometimes a demurrer may be brought because the statute of limitations has run.<br>\n<br>\nA demurrer can be brought as to the entire complaint, or as to one or more causes of action.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h4>Motion to Strike</h4>\n\n<p>A motion to strike is usually brought to request the court delete an improper allegation or statement from a complaint. Sometimes a motion to strike is directed to one word or phrase, sometimes it is directed to an entire cause of action. A motion to strike can also be filed with a demurrer, but the court charges a separate motion fee for each motion.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h4>Motion to Quash</h4>\n\n<p>A request for the Court to quash (void) service of the summons and complaint. The motion is usually made on the grounds that the litigant is not under the jurisdiction of the Court.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h4>General Denial</h4>\n\n<p>A response from the defendant denying all allegations contained within the complaint or the response from the plaintiff denying all allegations within the cross-complaint.</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Accordon Item --><!-- Start Accordion Item -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\" id=\"panelacc3334\" role=\"tab\">\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"panel-title\">\r\n        <a data-toggle=\"collapse\" class=\"collapsed\" href=\"#acc3334\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" aria-controls=\"acc3334\" role=\"button\">\r\n            What Can Happen If the Defendant Does Not File A Response?\r\n        </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" id=\"acc3334\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"panelacc3334\">\r\n    <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>If the defendant fails to respond within the time required after service of the complaint, the plaintiff can request the court to enter a default and issue a default judgment.

The other reason is \"incurable insanity\" which, unlike irreconcilable differences, must be proven.\u00a0\n\n</p><h4>Dissolution of Marriage (Divorce)</h4>\n\n<p>A dissolution of marriage, which is more commonly known as divorce, terminates the marriage and resolves marital issues including child custody, visitation, child support, spousal support, asset and debt division (real and personal property), former name restoration, restraining orders, and other issues identified by the parties.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h4>Summary Dissolution</h4>\n\n<p>If you and your spouse are in agreement that you want to divorce you may be able to obtain a summary dissolution. The criteria for a summary dissolution include:\u00a0</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>You were married for under five years,</li>\n\t<li>There were no children born during the marriage,</li>\n\t<li>You have very few community assets and debts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-summarydissolution.htm\">Read more information about this option</a>, which is less complicated than a regular dissolution of marriage.</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Accordon Item --><!-- Start Accordion Item -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\" id=\"panelacc3378\" role=\"tab\">\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"panel-title\">\r\n        <a data-toggle=\"collapse\" class=\"collapsed\" href=\"#acc3378\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" aria-controls=\"acc3378\" role=\"button\">\r\n            Legal Separation\r\n        </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" id=\"acc3378\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"panelacc3378\">\r\n    <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>Legal separation is similar to dissolution of marriage, except that the parties remain married to each other.

The investigator will then file a report with the court regarding whether the guardianship is appropriate.

The State, as the protector of all the people, makes the charge against someone accused of committing a crime because a crime is considered an act against society. Only the State, through the office of the District Attorney in each county, can charge individuals with criminal violations. The prosecuting attorney presents the charge against the accused person (defendant) on behalf of the State (plaintiff), and must prove to the judge or jury that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n\n<p>California statutes generally classify a crime as either a felony or a misdemeanor. A felony is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment in a state prison or by death. A misdemeanor is a lesser offense than a felony and generally is punishable by fine or imprisonment in county jail rather than in a state penitentiary.</p>\n\n<p>If you are the victim of a crime, there are resources available to you. Please contact the District Attorney\u2019s Office at (760) 878-0282 or Victim Witness Assistance at (760) 873-6669.</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div><!-- Start Accordion Module (+ and - icons) -->\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n        \n        <div class=\"accordion-wrapper\">\n            \n            <div class=\"controls\">\n                <a class=\"expandall\" href=\"#\">expand all</a> <a class=\"collapseall\" href=\"#\">collapse all</a> \n            </div>\n            <br>\n            <div aria-multiselectable=\"true\" class=\"panel-group\" id=\"bs-accordion\" role=\"tablist\">\n                <div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        <!-- Start Accordion Item -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\" id=\"panelacc3499\" role=\"tab\">\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"panel-title\">\r\n        <a data-toggle=\"collapse\" class=\"collapsed\" href=\"#acc3499\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" aria-controls=\"acc3499\" role=\"button\">\r\n            What Types of Cases Fall Under the Criminal Division?\r\n        </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" id=\"acc3499\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"panelacc3499\">\r\n    <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>There are 3 types of criminal cases:\n\n</p><p></p>\n\n<h4>Infractions</h4>\n\n<p>An infraction is a minor violation. Many traffic violations are infractions. The punishment for infractions is usually a fine. See the <a href=\"/divisions/traffic.htm\">Traffic division</a> for more information.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h4>Misdemeanors</h4>\n\n<p>A misdemeanor is punishable by imprisonment in the county jail, Informal Probation and/or by fine.</p>\n\n<p>Except in cases where a different punishment is prescribed by any law of this state, every offense declared to be a misdemeanor is punishable by imprisonment in the county jail, or by fine, or both. Defendants who plead guilty to a misdemeanor may be sentenced during the arraignment, unless the judge wishes to postpone sentencing in order to study a probation report. During the arraignment, if a defendant pleads not guilty to a misdemeanor, the judge will set the date for a trial. The trial will be held within 30 days if the defendant is in custody or within 45 days if the defendant is not in custody-unless the defendant waives the right to a speedy trial.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Examples of misdemeanors are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>petty theft</li>\n\t<li>vandalism</li>\n\t<li>driving with a suspended license</li>\n\t<li>drunk driving (also known as \u201cdui\u201d or \u201cdriving under the influence\u201d)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h4>Felonies</h4>\n\n<p>A felony is the most serious crime and is punishable by death, or imprisonment in the state prison, Formal Probation or county jail and fines.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>If a defendant pleads guilty to a felony at the arraignment, he or she must be represented by an attorney (unless the defendant, in a noncapital case, waives the right to one). After a guilty plea, the judge will set the case for sentencing. If a defendant pleads not guilty to a felony, a preliminary hearing is held.

In addition, a misdemeanor may be charged against you and your driving privilege suspended.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a financial hardship and can show that you are unable to pay the full amount for the offense(s) on your infraction traffic ticket or infraction Fish &amp; Wildlife ticket, you may request the Court to consider your ability to pay in setting the fine amount. Also, if you are ordered to pay a fine you may ask the Court for an installment payment plan that is based on your ability to pay, or ask the Court to approve community service due to financial hardship. You may be asked to provide financial documentation in support of your request. To request the Court consider your ability to pay, you may file a <strong><em>Petition for Consideration re Ability to Pay Infraction Citation (<a href=\"/documents/inyo/TR105-PetnAbilitytoPay.pdf\">form TR-105</a>)</em></strong>, subject to the following limitations:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>You may only submit form <a href=\"/documents/inyo/TR105-PetnAbilitytoPay.pdf\">TR-105</a> if you wish to <strong>plead guilty</strong> and be convicted of the violation(s) contained on your citation, OR if you have already been convicted and need to request a modification of your fine amount.</li>\n\t<li>Form TR-105 cannot be used to request bail be waived or reduced in order to contest your citation by Trial by Declaration or Court Trial.

There are books available in the Inyo County Law Library on the ground floor of the Independence Courthouse, which explain different legal theories and the elements necessary to prove your case. Small claims court is informal, so you do not have to know the law. However it will improve your chances for success if you can distill the essential elements of the case and present them to the court in a clear and concise manner.</p>\n\n<p>The opposing side is entitled to see all evidence before it is submitted to the court; therefore, if you plan to bring documents to show the court, you need to make extra copies for the other side, and for the judge. It will save time if you can each have a copy to refer to in court.</p>\n\n<p>Be sure you are on time for the trial. Although the small claims trial is informal, you must be prepared with witnesses, books, receipts and other documents needed to prove your case. If your witnesses are not willing to come to court voluntarily, you can request that the court clerk issue a <strong>subpoena</strong>. A subpoena is a court order that requires the witness to appear. The witness has a right to charge a fee for appearing. If you do not have in your possession the records or papers necessary to prove your case, you may request the court clerk issue a <strong>subpoena <em>duces tecum</em></strong> in advance of the trial date, which orders the documents you are requesting be delivered to court for trial.</p>\n\n<p>Many cases are scheduled for the same time, so each case is given limited time. You should describe the events clearly and concisely. Before you present to the court any photographs, diagrams or documents, you must first show them to the opposing side. If possible, observe other small claims proceedings in the same department or courtroom where your case is scheduled, prior to the day you are to appear. You will get an idea how to proceed in an organized manner due to the limited time available for each case.</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Accordon Item --><!-- Start Accordion Item -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"panel-heading\" id=\"panelacc3417\" role=\"tab\">\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"panel-title\">\r\n        <a data-toggle=\"collapse\" class=\"collapsed\" href=\"#acc3417\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" aria-controls=\"acc3417\" role=\"button\">\r\n            What if I need an interpreter? \r\n        </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" id=\"acc3417\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"panelacc3417\">\r\n    <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>If you do not speak or understand English, you may bring a family member or friend to court with you to interpret.

It conducts its investigations under the auspices of the Superior Court and has broad access to public officials, employees, records and information.</p>\n\n<p>The grand jury\u2019s fact-finding efforts result in written reports which contain specific recommendations aimed at identifying problems and offering recommendations for improving government operations and enhancing responsiveness. In this way, the grand jury acts as a representative of county residents in promoting government accountability.</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div><div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n                        <h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Volunteer to Serve As A Grand Juror</h3>\r\n                            \r\n         \r\n        <p>Service on the Civil Grand Jury is an excellent opportunity to learn about the inner workings of government, while providing a valuable service to the community. The 11 members of the Civil Grand Jury serve for one year (July \u2013 June) and are empowered to investigate the operations of county, city and district governments; provide civil oversight of local government departments and agencies; and respond to citizen complaints.\n\n</p><p>The Civil Grand Jury sets its own agenda and meeting schedule. Much of the work is performed in small committees allowing for considerable flexibility in the work schedule and meeting locations.</p>\n\n<p>Grand Jurors are compensated $25 per full panel meeting and $10 per special or committee meeting; they are also compensated he standard IRS mileage rates.</p>\n\n<p>To volunteer to serve as a Grand Juror please complete the <a href=\"/documents/inyo/Grand-Jury-Application.pdf\">Grand Jury Application</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can return the completed application to:</p>\n\n<p>OFFICE OF THE JURY COMMISSIONER<br>\nPO BOX 1508<br>\nBISHOP, CA 93515</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div><div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n                        <h3 class=\"doubleBars\">To Contact The Civil Grand Jury</h3>\r\n                            \r\n         \r\n        <p>The Grand Jury receives letters of complaint from citizens alleging mistreatment by public officials, suspicions of misconduct, or governmental inefficiencies.

The jury generally limits investigations to the operations of governmental agencies, charges of wrongdoing within public agencies, or the performance of unlawful acts by public officials.

This cherished right is guaranteed by both the United States and California Constitutions. You may be summoned to render an important service as a juror. You have enjoyed the privileges of citizenship and the protection of your liberties and property through our system of self-government. Therefore, for a short time, you may be summoned to serve as a juror, an officer of the court, along with the attorneys and the judge. As a juror, you will be an important member of the judicial system of Inyo County and California. Most people who serve find the experience to be fascinating and rewarding.\n\n</p><div class=\"noteModule\">\n<p><strong>Please Note: </strong>The Court is concerned about your health and safety while serving as a juror during the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, please wear a face mask <u><strong>at all times</strong></u> in the courthouse, create <strong>6 feet</strong> of distance between you and others and frequently wash your hands.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>While we know these are difficult times, jury service is an important obligation and we ask for your patience and cooperation in fulfilling your civic duty.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you are sick or have respiratory symptoms, a fever or a cough, DO NOT report for jury service.\u00a0</strong> If you do not report, please be sure to contact the Court immediately so that you are not marked as failing to appear.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Eligible jurors must appear as ordered. However, if you are not qualified, requesting a postponement or wishing to be excused from this service you <strong>MUST</strong> either fill out your summons or click the Response button bellow.\u00a0 <strong>All requests must be received five (5) days prior to your service date.</strong></p>\n\n<p></p>\n</div>\n\n<h4>Location of Service:</h4>\n\n<p>Jury trials are held at the Independence Courthouse.\u00a0 If personal transportation is an issue, please see the <a href=\"https://www.estransit.com/\">Eastern Sierra Transit Authority</a> website for the public transportation schedule.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h4>Trial Duration:</h4>\n\n<p>Trials are of varying length. Many trials are completed in 2-3 days, but some may go longer. The trial Judge will advise you of probable trial duration and may excuse you from serving on a particular case if your service would amount to extreme hardship.</p>\n\n<h4>Term of Service:</h4>\n\n<p>Inyo County operates on the <a href=\"/documents/inyo/OneDayOneTrial.pdf\">One Day or One Trial</a> system.\u00a0 This means that a juror generally serves for one day or the duration of a trial. Typically, if you are not chosen for jury selection after one day at the courthouse, then your service is done for at least one year. If you are selected to serve on a jury, after the trial is over, your service is also completed for at least one year. In most cases jury trials are conducted from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. There are brief recesses during the day and you will have at least an hour for lunch if jury service goes all day.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h4>Jury Fees:</h4>\n\n<p>No daily or mileage fees are paid for the first day of service. After the first day fees will be paid at the rate of $15.00 per day and 34 cents per mile (one way) from your residence to the courthouse. Check with the Jury Clerk to be sure that the Court has your correct mileage before you leave.</p>\n\n<p>Please allow 4-6 weeks from the completion of the trial for your check to come in the mail.

You or your attorney can:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"square2\">\n\t<li>Question the officer who <em>gave </em>you the ticket,</li>\n\t<li>Bring witnesses,</li>\n\t<li>Present evidence, and</li>\n\t<li>Argue the law.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>After the evidence is presented the judge may rule immediately whether you are guilty or not guilty or the case may be taken under submission before deciding. If the case is taken under submission, you will be notified of the ruling by mail or you may choose to return to court.</p>\n\n<p>If you are found not guilty and you paid bail before the trial, the full amount will be refunded to you (or the person who paid) by mail. If you are found guilty and you paid bail before the trial, the court will apply the bail money to the fine. If the fine is less than the bail deposit, any balance to be refunded will be mailed to you by the court. If the fine is more than the bail deposit, you will be responsible\u00a0 for paying the balance due or requesting community service (Penal Code section 1209.5), a payment plan, or a reduction\u00a0 based on inability\u00a0 to pay (Vehicle Code section 42003).</p>\n\n<p>If you disagree with the court's decision, you may file an appeal.
