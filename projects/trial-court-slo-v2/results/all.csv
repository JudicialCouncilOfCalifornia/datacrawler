<strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong>

<strong>What is a Civil Harassment Restraining Order?</strong>

<p>It is a court order that helps protect people from harassment by roommates, neighbors, co-workers or other people not close to you.</p>

<p>If you are being abused by&nbsp;your spouse or&nbsp;registered domestic partner, ex-spouse, boyfriend or ex-boyfriend, girlfriend or ex-girlfriend,&nbsp;parent, child, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, mother-in-law, son-in-law then you may request a&nbsp;Domestic Violence Restraining Order, not a Civil Harassment Restraining Order.</p>

<strong>Can I get one?</strong>

<p>You may obtain a civil harassment restraining order if you are worried about your safety because someone has stalked you, harassed you, sexually assaulted you or threatened you with violence.</p>

<strong>What facts does the judge need to know about?</strong>

<p>Your written declaration must state sufficient, detailed facts that show reasonable proof of a past act or acts of abuse. Your written declaration should contain dates, a detailed description of the recent abuse and a detailed description of any injuries.</p>

<p>If someone you know also witnessed any incident, that person may submit a declaration describing the incident. If you have police reports, photographs, declarations by others or other supporting documents, attach a copy to your CH-100 Request for Orders, labeled as Exhibits and number each exhibit in your declaration.</p>

<p>If you are requesting protection for another person, he or she must live in your household or be a family member. Your declaration must state&nbsp;the facts showing why that person also needs protection.</p>

<p>The Court will grant or deny your request for temporary orders solely on the basis of your declaration. Your declaration must contain detailed facts based on your own knowledge.</p></p>",Civil Harassment Restraining Order,

https://www.slo.courts.ca.gov/dv/traffic.htm,"<p><strong>Your Courtesy Bail Notice</strong>

<p>The Court sends you a Courtesy Bail Notice once we receive your citation. (It may take an agency 2-3 weeks to get us your citation info.) The Courtesy Notice provides information about how to handle your ticket, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bail amount you owe</li>
	<li>Due date when payment must be made</li>
	<li>Traffic School eligibility criteria</li>
	<li>""Fix-It"" ticket information: how to clear a proof of correction violation</li>
	<li>Court appearances: where and when to report, should you choose to do so</li>
</ul>

<p>Take action on the citation by its listed due date. <strong>Not receiving your Courtesy Bail Notice is <em>not</em> a legal excuse</strong> for failing to resolve the citation on time. Allow 10 days for delivery and processing when submitting anything by mail.</p>

<p>The DMV may suspend your driver’s license if you <strong>fail to appear or take action</strong> by the citation's due date. This DMV hold will restrict your ability to renew your driver's license or attend traffic school.</p>

<p>The court may refer your case to collections which may&nbsp;add up to&nbsp;$300.00 in civil assessment fees if you fail to pay your fines on time.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Paying the Citation</strong>

<p>Financial Hardship or Ability to Pay</p>

<p>To ask the Court to consider your ability to pay due to financial hardship and decide whether to approve a reduced fine with a payment plan or community service, you may schedule an appearance in Court for arraignment without the deposit of bail by contacting the clerk's office.</p>

<p>Payment plans and Community Work service are available for fines ordered by the Court. You may contact the clerk's office by phone or email slotraffic@slo.courts.ca.gov for more information.</p>

<p>Methods of Payment</p>

<p>The Court accepts credit or debit cards (Visa, MasterCard, and Discover),&nbsp;personal checks, money orders, cashier’s checks, and cash</p>

<p>If you are wishing to post bail and contest your citation, you must contact the clerk's office prior to payment either by phone or by correspondence. Failure to contact the clerk's office prior to payment will result in your case being closed. This is ONLY necessary if you are intending on pleading NOT GUILTY.</p>

<p>If you have appeared in Court and were granted Traffic School with a new total amount due, that amount does reflect the&nbsp;Traffic School fee. Your case will or has been continued with a Traffic School due date.</p>

<p>NOTE: The Court's vendor&nbsp;charges an additional Administrative Fee on all credit card payments.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to make sure payment is actually received by the Court prior to your appearance date.</p>

<p><strong>A $30.00 charge will be added on all returned checks.</strong></p>

<strong>Paying Bail</strong>

<p>Bail&nbsp;is the dollar amount associated with the&nbsp;code section you were cited for noted on your citation.&nbsp;If you choose to pay the bail on the citation <em>without</em> going to your arraignment or trial, it is a bail forfeiture. The citation is deemed paid, and the resulting conviction will be reported to DMV if you were cited for a reportable violation. Some violations require a mandatory court appearance and cannot simply be paid.</p>

<p>If there are mechanical or insurance violations included in the citation, the Court requires you to submit proof of correction before any reduction in bail can be applied. If you do <em>not</em> provide proof of correction, the total bail amount must be paid. Proof may be submitted either by mail or in person.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Payment Alternatives</strong>

<p>For a person who wants <strong>community work service</strong> instead of paying a fine or for those who just want&nbsp;more time to pay, the clerk of the Court is authorized to accept a written plea of guilty at the&nbsp;counter (or by mail) and continue the case for payments. This procedure is known as a “<strong>Counter&nbsp;</strong><strong>Arraignment</strong>” and is designed to save time and effort of sitting through a court session. This option is&nbsp;also available for payment of Traffic School fees.</p>

<p>A defendant who enters a guilty plea in writing at the clerk’s office will be given the options to request a one-time 90 day extension for a $30 time extension fee or they may request monthly payments of $50/$100 per month for a $35 payment plan fee. This option is also available for Traffic School fees.</p>

<p>Fine can be satisfied by completing community work service or some combination of work and fine. There is a required minimum payment due when the Counter Arraignment is signed.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Proof of Correction</strong>

<p>How to obtain Proof of Correction for Mechanical, Registration, License and Insurance Violations (“fix-it tickets”):</p>

<p>The citing officer must allege on the citation that the violation is correctable. Violations marked with an asterisk on your courtesy bail notice designate correctable violations.</p>

<p><em>Advisement:</em><em> Fraudulent or altered documentation may be referred to the Office of the District Attorney for a full investigation and possible criminal prosecution. </em></p>

<p><em>A photo copy of the signed off citation is not acceptable; unless, the submitted citation is a copy with an original signature of Law Enforcement or DMV. </em></p>

<strong>Mechanical Violations</strong>

<p>Proof of correction violations (required under VC40610) will be dismissed once the following have occurred (if taken care of in a timely manner).</p>

<ol>
	<li>The item is corrected (e.g. the tail light is fixed).</li>
	<li>An authorized representative signs the citation or Courtesy Bail Notice certifying it was corrected.</li>
	<li>The signed citation is submitted with a mandatory Fix-it Fee to the court.</li>
</ol>

<p>Authorized representatives include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>All California Law Enforcement agencies</li>
	<li>Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)<br/>
	(for license and registration issues)</li>
	<li>Any Station in California licensed to inspect and certify for the violation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many agencies charge a fee to sign the cite; this is different than the&nbsp;State Administration&nbsp;Fix-it Fee&nbsp;required by the court.</p>

<p>If you are delinquent in appearing, proof of correction will probably not reduce the bail or fine.</p>

<strong>Registration and License Violations</strong>

<p>If you are charged with a violation of the registration law, you must show proof to the Court that the vehicle has been registered, junked, or receipted as planned non-operation <strong>after</strong> the date of citation. A&nbsp;$25 State Mandated Fix-it fee will also be due.&nbsp;If&nbsp;proof of Release of Liability is submitted and it&nbsp;is dated with DMV <strong>prior </strong>to the violation date the $25&nbsp;Fix-it Fee is waived.</p>

<p>You may have DMV ""Sign-Off"" the violation on the back of your citation or you may submit a copy of your registration, proof of your junked or dismantled vehicle or proof the vehicle has been placed in non-operational status ""Non-Op'd"".</p>

<p>If you are charged with a license violation you may have the DMV sign off the back of your citation or sign your Courtesy Bail Notice. You may also provide a copy of your driver's license to the court. <strong>Sign-off only qualifies if the violation is filed as an ""infraction"" and the citing officer allows for correction. </strong></p>

<strong>Insurance Violations</strong>

<p>If you were charged with a violation of the proof of financial responsibility law (VC16028), the Court will dismiss the charge only if it is shown that the defendant was financially responsible (i.e. there was an insurance policy that covered the defendant/driver <strong>on the date of violation, or proof&nbsp;the the vehicle was insured at the time of the violation)</strong>. A Fixit-Fee is payable to the Court.</p>

<p>If you purchase a 6 month insurance policy&nbsp;<strong>after </strong>the violation date and <strong>your name </strong>is on the policy, the court will suspend half of the bail amount due that carries with that violation (VC16028(a)).</p>

<p><em>Advisement: </em><em>Fraudulent or altered documentation may be referred to the Office of the District Attorney for a full investigation and possible criminal prosecution</em></p>

<strong>What if I no longer own the vehicle or it is inoperable?</strong>

<p>If you no longer own the vehicle or it is inoperable, it is still your responsibility to clear the citation by either paying the bail or appearing in court. If you have junked the car or it is deemed inoperable, you will need to show proof of a DMV junk certificate or planned non-operation receipt to the Court. A Fixit-Fee is payable to the Court. (if applicable)</p>

<strong>Am I responsible for an equipment violation on a car I am driving that is not mine?</strong>

<p>Yes, unless the ticket is issued in the name of the registered owner of the vehicle you are driving. It is not an excuse that it was not your vehicle; it is still your responsibility to clear the citation if the citation is issued in your name.<br/>

https://www.slo.courts.ca.gov/dv/traffic.htm,"<p><strong>Overview</strong>

<p>Traffic School is a program that allows persons cited for certain moving violations to receive instruction in driving and traffic safety.</p>

<p>Your courtesy bail notice will indicate if the violation you&nbsp;were cited for is traffic&nbsp;school eligible for a confidential traffic school conviction.&nbsp;You must meet the eligibility&nbsp;requirements noted below.</p>

<p>The clerk may grant a request to attend an eight hour traffic school program if you meet all of the program requirements.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Steps You Take</strong>

<ul>
	<li>You must meet all <strong>eligibility requirements</strong> listed below.</li>
	<li>You may attend a DMV certified traffic school in your area of residence.</li>
	<li>You must pay the entire non-refundable fee to the court before you attend the class.</li>
</ul>

<p>All <strong>fees</strong> and proof of correction (if applicable) <strong>are due</strong> by the due date shown on your courtesy bail notice. The traffic school fee is comprised of the highest bail amount for traffic school eligible violations, plus a State Administrative Fee. Your check or money order must equal the total non-refundable fee shown on your courtesy bail notice.</p>

<p><strong>Traffic School</strong> proof of completion <strong>is due</strong> 13 weeks for adults (8 weeks for minors) from your original due date. Your arraignment or due date and Traffic School completion date are indicated on your courtesy bail notice.</p>

<p>If you meet the eligibility requirements, mail the&nbsp;bottom portion of your courtesy bail notice with any proof of correction and your check or money order to the return address indicated on your courtesy bail notice.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Find a Traffic School</strong>

<p>San Luis Obispo Court approved traffic schools:</p>

<ul>
	<li>California Traffic Safety Institute<br/>
	(If attending a classroom based traffic school you must call them and make an appointment.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Traffic schools charge <strong>an additional fee</strong> to enroll, separate from the Court's traffic school fee.</p>

<strong>Be On Time</strong>

<p>If you fail to submit proof of Traffic School completion to the Court by the assigned due date, the Court will order your Traffic School fee converted to bail and forfeited with no further proceedings. A bail forfeiture is a conviction and will be reported to the Department of Motor Vehicles.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

https://www.slo.courts.ca.gov/gi/index.htm,"<p>The Superior Court of San Luis Obispo provides interpreters for all non-English speaking defendants, parties, and witnesses needed during courtroom proceedings.

<p>The Court employs Spanish-speaking staff at the Clerk's Offices.&nbsp; In the event no bilingual staff is available, the Court provides an over-the-phone interpreter using the services of an outside telephonic language interpretation provider.</p>

<p>The Court employs Certified Spanish Court Interpreters to provide language services at no cost to defendants, parties and witnesses in all court proceedings.&nbsp; This includes the following case types:</p>

<ul>
	<li>criminal</li>
	<li>juvenile delinquency</li>
	<li>juvenile dependency</li>
	<li>mental health matters</li>
	<li>family law</li>
	<li>civil harassment</li>
	<li>unlawful detainer</li>
	<li>traffic</li>
	<li>small claims</li>
	<li>limited and unlimited civil cases</li>
</ul>

<p>The services of a Spanish interpreter may be requested at any time from Clerks’ Office or Courtroom staff.&nbsp;&nbsp; In cases other than criminal and juvenile matters, a request for an interpreter shall be made as early as possible in the process in order to ensure an interpreter is available at the time of hearing.&nbsp; Form INT-300 Request for Interpreter (Civil) may be completed and returned to the Interpreter Coordinator’s Office as follows:</p>

<p></p>

<p>For court users with family law, small claims, probate, civil harassment, unlawful detainer, and other limited and unlimited civil cases who speak a language other than Spanish, an interpreter may be requested using form INT-300 Request for Interpreter (Civil).&nbsp; The form should be completed and returned to the Interpreter Coordinator’s Office as soon as possible, but at least 72 hours prior to the scheduled hearing.&nbsp; Once received, the Interpreter Coordinator will, if possible, book the services of a qualified court interpreter for the date and time specified in the Request for Interpreter.</p>

<p>Request for Interpreter Form</p>

<p>Attorneys of record for parties in civil, family law and probate matters shall complete form&nbsp;INT-300 Request for Interpreter (Civil) and return the form to the Interpreter Coordinator , and in the event the party or witness will not be present at any hearing for which an interpreter was requested, shall give the court as much notice as possible.</p>

        <p><strong>General Jury Service Information</strong>

<p>Jury service is mandatory. Prospective juror names are obtained from voter registration and DMV records.&nbsp;By law, prospective jurors are randomly chosen and because of this, we regret that we cannot accept volunteers for jury duty.</p>

<p>Normally, service may be required as often as once per year. Service lasts from one day to the length of the trial, starting at 8:00am and ending at 5:00pm. <strong>Business attire is suggested. No tank tops, shorts, bare midriffs, or bare feet are permitted in the courtroom.</strong></p>

<p>When entering any court facility all persons are subject to <strong>screening through a security device</strong>. You will walk through a metal detector and your handbags, briefcases, backpacks and containers may be X-rayed. Weapons of any type will not be permitted into any court facility. Items such as: knives (including pocket knives), guns, stun guns, pepper spray, mace, scissors, knitting needles, corkscrews, or any item that may be used as a weapon are not permitted. All weapons are prohibited and it is a felony to bring them into court buildings. <strong>Please allow extra time</strong> for this screening process.</p>

<p>Often students, teachers, physicians and small business owners and others with unusual schedules think that they are exempt from serving on jury duty. We cannot exempt or excuse you; however you are eligible for a onetime postponement for up to 6 months.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Rescheduling Jury Service</strong>

<p><strong>Excuse or postponement request <em>must</em> be received by Jury Services prior to your summons date.</strong></p>

<p>Jury service may be postponed one time for up to 6 months. There are no permanent excuses to jury service except verified medical illness. If approved for postponement you will receive a new summons for that date or the closest one available approximately 4&nbsp;weeks before your new appearance date.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Payment for Service</strong>

<p>Pursuant to section 230a of the Labor Code, your employer cannot prevent you from serving as a juror and is not required to pay you while on jury duty. However, the Superior Court will pay you $15.00 per day starting with your second day of service, plus mileage.<br/>

<strong>Parking Validation</strong>

<p>Jury Services validates parking <em><strong>only</strong></em> at the parking structure at 842 Palm Street, across from the Palm Theatre.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Take the ticket from the dispenser when entering.</li>
	<li>Bring that ticket into Jury Services for validation on each day of appearance.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Street Parking</strong>

<p>You may park for free on the street - in a two hour or more space - <em><strong>only</strong></em> if you cannot use the garage because:</p>

<ul>
	<li>you're in an oversized vehicle,</li>
	<li>you rode a motorcycle,</li>
	<li>or the parking garage is full.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the <strong><em>only</em></strong> reasons you will be allowed to park on the street, and only in a two hour or more space. If one of these situations does not apply to you, you may receive a parking ticket.</p>

<p>Place your juror parking card (located on the top of your summons) on your dashboard - the summons date and juror badge number must visible. You do <em>not</em> need to put money in the meter.</p>

<p>The summons date <strong>must</strong> be a current date. If it is not a current date, go into Jury Services and request an updated form for your dash. This updated form must be placed on your dash so you do not receive a parking ticket.</p>

<strong>Wireless Internet Access</strong>

<p>To be employed by the Superior Court, a court reporter must possess a valid Certified Shorthand Reporters (CSR) license, which is granted to successful candidates who pass the examination administered by the Department of Consumer Affairs of the State of California.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<strong>Court Reporter Coverage</strong>

<p>The Court will provide an Official Court Reporter to in forma pauperis litigants in civil and family law matters upon request for the following types of hearings: family law trials, family support hearings, family law requests for order, hearings on requests for civil or family law restraining orders, unlimited jurisdiction civil trials, civil law and motion, probate, conservatorships, guardianships, and mental health proceedings.</p>

<p>In order to be eligible for a court reporter, the litigant must have an order granting a fee waiver on file in the case.&nbsp; In matters that do not require a filing fee, such as requests for civil or family law restraining orders, a party who is eligible for a waiver of fees must file a Request to Waive Court Fees.</p>

<p>The party requesting a court reporter must file and serve the request no later than seven (7) days prior to the scheduled hearing, with notice to all parties. A failure to file a timely request may be considered a waiver of a court reporter for the scheduled hearing.</p>

<p>If you are not eligible for a fee waiver and wish your matter to be reported, you must hire a reporter privately and are responsible for all fees and costs related to the reporting services. Please call (805) 706-3605 to request a list of private court reporters or court reporting agencies.</p>

<p>A conservatorship is a court proceeding where a judge appoints a responsible person or organization to care for another adult who cannot care for him/herself or his/her finances.</p>

<p>Before letters of conservatorship can be issued by the clerk, a proposed conservator must view a video and have read the <em>Handbook for Conservators</em>, now available online.</p>

<p>Guardianships are protective proceedings where the court gives a responsible person the custody of a minor or power to manage the minor’s property, or both.</p>

<p>The forms to initiate a guardianship case are available in our Guardianship self-help page.</p>

<p><strong>Wills -</strong> The clerk's office will accept wills after the person who wrote it is deceased. There is a $50 fee for lodging a will with the court.</p>

<strong>Probate Appeals</strong>

<p>In an appeal, a higher court reviews the order or judgment of a lower court. Any party may appeal from an unfavorable decision based upon whether there was enough evidence to support the judgment or whether errors of law were committed during or before trial which harmed the appealing party.</p>

<p>The fee for filing an appeal on a Superior Court decision is $775.00. The clerks do not have forms for filing an appeal.</p>

<p>On a decision of the Superior Court, the notice of appeal must be filed within 60 days after the mailing or personal service of the entry of judgment. If a Notice has not been mailed or personally served, the appeal period is 180 days from the entry of judgment by the court. Permission to file late is rarely given. Filing of a notice of appeal does not stop enforcement of the judgment. You must still comply with all court orders.<br/>

<p>If you have a family law case opened, you may file a Request for Order&nbsp;to obtain temporary orders or modify court orders.&nbsp; Types of family law cases that you may file a Request for Order&nbsp;into include: Divorce, Legal Separation, Nullity, Petition to Establish Parental Relationship, Petition for Custody and Support, Local Child Support Agency - Complaint Regarding Parental Obligations and Domestic Violence Prevention Act.&nbsp; You may request a hearing in any of these cases.&nbsp; A Request for Order&nbsp;is an optional step and is not required to obtain a final judgment in your dissolution of marriage, legal separation, nullity or paternity case.</p>

<p>If you do not have a family law case opened, you may not file a Request for Order.&nbsp; To&nbsp;learn more about how to open a family law case you may&nbsp;click on a type of case listed above or&nbsp;visit the Self-Help Center / Family Law Facilitator Office.</p>

<p>Generally, you will obtain a hearing date within 30 days from the date you file your Request for Order documents. If you have an emergency and need emergency temporary orders before your hearing date in 30 days, then you may consider filing an Ex Parte Request for Order. An Ex Parte&nbsp;Request for Order&nbsp;requires additional forms and procedures from a regular Request for Order.</p>

<p>Ex Parte Request for Order&nbsp;are for emergencies only. Generally, an emergency is when there is or likely will be “blood on the floor.” This means that there is actual harm taking place or it is likely that if the court does not make an emergency order there will be harm.</p>

Examples of emergencies are:

<ul>
	<li>The other parent has taken the child, threatened that he/she will leave the state and hide, and you actually believe that they will do so.&nbsp;You need an ex parte order that returns the child to you and prevents him from leaving the area with the child.</li>
	<li>Your child needs emergency medical treatment that requires both parents’ consent and the other side refuses to give consent.&nbsp;You need an ex parte order that allows you to have the authority to give consent.</li>
	<li>The other parent has just been charged with child abuse or child molestation of your child, and there is a visitation order in effect that allows visitation for the coming weekend.&nbsp;You need an ex parte order that prevents visitation pending a full hearing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unless there is a showing of immediate harm to the child or immediate risk that the child will be removed from the State of California, the judge may properly deny your request.<br/>

<strong>The Importance of the Declaration</strong>

<p>The declaration is a persuasive document that provides the judge as much detail as you can give and is a very&nbsp;important part of your case.&nbsp;If you are requesting emergency ex parte orders, your declaration must explain what the emergency is. Your declaration must explain all the reasons the court should grant the orders you are requesting.</p>

<p>It is your job to give the judge facts, details, dates, description of events, etc. so the judge can reach the conclusion that is most favorable to you. In your declaration, you must answer the question about why the judge should grant the orders you are requesting. On the day of the hearing, you may forget to tell the judge your whole story. So, all the facts and details you want the judge to consider should be stated in your declaration.</p>

<p>Your declaration may be up to 10 pages long,&nbsp;doubled spaced using 12 point font. When writing or typing your declaration, keep in mind the judge will have to read this and refer to it at your hearing. Use descriptive headings for your paragraphs. This should tell the judge what the paragraph is about. You should start with the most important issue and the most recent event. When the judge is finished reading your declaration there should be no doubt about what you want, why you want it and why the judge should do what you want.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Attaching Documents (Exhibits)</strong>

<p>Exhibits are documents that support something you are saying in your declaration. If you believe there are documents the judge should read, you may attach them to your declaration. You must properly describe the document in your declaration by stating what the document is, what exhibit number you have assigned it and why the document is important for the judge to consider, e.g. “Attached as Exhibit 1 is a true and correct copy of my paystubs for the last 3 months showing my gross monthly income is $1550.<br/>

<strong>What Orders Can You Request</strong>

<p><strong>Legal Custody</strong>: Legal custody deals with the parents’ right to make the decisions relating to the child’s health, education and welfare.&nbsp; One or both parents can have legal custody.&nbsp; If both parents are making decisions about the child it is called joint legal custody.&nbsp; When writing your declaration you need to explain why it is in the child’s best interest for one or both parents to make these decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Physical Custody</strong>: Physical custody deals with the days and times that the child will spend with each parent.&nbsp; If the child primarily lives with one parent it is called physical custody.&nbsp; If you are requesting that both parents spend a substantial period of time with the child, it is called Joint Physical Custody.&nbsp; When writing your declaration you need to explain why your proposed physical custody request is in the child’s best interest.</p>

<p><strong>Visitation</strong>: Visitation is the time&nbsp;the child spends with the parent who does not primarily live with the child.&nbsp; When writing your declaration you need to explain why your proposed visitation schedule is in the child’s best interest.&nbsp; There are several options to choose from when it comes to visitation, generally they are: (1) Reasonable Visitation (2) Specific Visitation Schedule (3) Supervised Visitation.&nbsp; <em>Reasonable visitation</em> does not define the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child.&nbsp; A reasonable visitation court order usually works when both parents are in agreement about the time share that each is to have with the child.&nbsp; A <em>specific visitation schedule</em> defines the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child.&nbsp; A specific visitation schedule may be necessary for parents who have a difficult time agreeing on the days and times that each parent will spend with the child.&nbsp; <em>Supervised Visitation</em> requires that a responsible adult be present during any visitation times with the child.&nbsp; A supervised visitation order may be necessary if there are reasonable concerns that a parent may harm the child if left alone.&nbsp; You may request a non-professional or professional supervisor.&nbsp; Click here for more&nbsp;information on Supervised Visitation.</p>

<p><strong>Prevent Child Abduction</strong>:&nbsp; If there are facts that show that the other parent may be thinking of taking the child and hiding the child from you, then you may request orders to prevent the other parent from abducting the child.&nbsp; When writing your declaration you need to explain what the other party has done or plans to do to take and hide the child from you.</p>

<p><strong>Child Support</strong>:&nbsp; Both parents are required to financially support the minor child.&nbsp; Child support is the amount of money that one parent pays to the other to equalize the financial responsibility.&nbsp; The amount of child support is arrived by inputting several numbers into a formula.&nbsp; The main factors that are taken into consideration are: (1) Dad’s gross monthly income (2) Mom’s gross monthly income and (3) Percentage of time that is spent with the child.&nbsp; When writing your declaration, you must address each of these factors.&nbsp; The judge needs to know what you are claiming each of these numbers is and also how you arrived at those numbers.&nbsp; Other facts that may be discussed in your declaration are: (1) the other parent’s ability to earn income, (2) the number of other biological children living with you (3) the amount of child care costs per month (4) the amount of rental income received (5) the amount of property taxes and mortgage interest paid per month and (6) the amount paid per month for health insurance premiums.&nbsp; You may attach any supporting documentation to your declaration as exhibits.&nbsp; Be prepared for what the amount of child support might be.&nbsp; Before you file your OSC, the Self-Help Center / Family Law Facilitator may help you calculate the amount of child support or you may go to https://www.cse.ca.gov/ChildSupport/cse/guidelineCalculator to calculate the child support amount on your own.</p>

<p><strong>Spousal Support</strong>:&nbsp; (formerly known as “ALIMONY”):&nbsp; The judge has discretion to order the payment of spousal support.&nbsp; The judge will consider several factors before deciding whether to award spousal support, the amount of spousal support and the length of time that spousal support will be received.&nbsp; Some of the factors the judge will consider are:&nbsp; (1) Spouse’s ability to pay spousal support (2) Other spouse’s need to receive spousal support and (3) Standard of living during your marriage.&nbsp; When writing your declaration, you must address each of these factors.&nbsp; The judge needs to know what you think your spouse’s income is and how you arrived at that number.&nbsp; In addition, your declaration must give details that describe your standard of living during the marriage which may include the number and kinds of vacations you took together, the kind of home you lived in, the kind of cars you owned, etc.Other factors that you may include in your declaration are the following: (1) Length of marriage (2) Age and health of each spouse (3) How much income each spouse can earn on their own (4) What the expenses of each spouse are (5) The history of the way the couple handled money during the marriage (6) Whether having a job would make it too hard to take care of the children (7) Whether one spouse helped the other get an education, training, career, or professional license (8) Whether there was domestic violence in the marriage or domestic partnership and (9) Whether one spouse's career was affected by unemployment, or by taking care of the children or home.</p>

<p><strong>Attorney's Fees and Costs</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;You may request that the other party pay for your attorney’s fees and costs.&nbsp; The judge has discretion to grant or deny this request.&nbsp; When writing your declaration, you must establish in sufficient detail that the other party has the financial ability to pay your attorney’s fees and costs.</p>

<p><strong>Property Restraint</strong>:&nbsp; You may request that the other party be prohibited from cashing out 401K’s, checking accounts, savings accounts, etc.&nbsp; When writing your declaration, you must describe why this order is necessary.</p>

&nbsp;

<strong>Parking Citations</strong>

<p>Parking citations are generally processed by each issuing city or law enforcement agency, and may not go through the court at all.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions on your citation. Contact the city or agency that issued the parking citation for information.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Infractions</strong>

<p>An infraction is a violation of or failure to comply with certain provisions of the Vehicle Code, local ordinance or other law or statute.</p>

<p>Example infractions are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Speeding,</li>
	<li>Automobile equipment needing repair, and</li>
	<li>Expired vehicle registrations</li>
</ul>

<p>Punishment of an infraction is a fine only. The total fine for an infraction can be over $200. It may also include mandatory Community Work Service, such as trash pickup, in the case of littering.</p>

<p>Traffic infractions are enforced by law enforcement who issue traffic tickets (“citations”). It is important to read the information on the front and back of the citation.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Misdemeanors</strong>

<p>Examples of misdemeanors are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>reckless driving,</li>
	<li>driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs (DUI),</li>
	<li>and hit and run.</li>
</ul>

<p>These violations are <em>not</em> handled by the Traffic court. They may be misdemeanors or felonies, and they are heard in the Criminal Courts.</p>

<p>Misdemeanor offenses are typically punishable by up to a year in jail, by a fine not exceeding $1,000 (plus assessment and fees), or both. (Specific California laws may raise these limits for some offenses.)<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Mandatory Appearance?</strong>

<p>Some violations require a mandatory appearance in court; others may be handled by mail or on the phone.</p>

<strong>Mandatory appearance violations</strong>

<p>These require your appearance in court on the date/time/location indicated on your Citation/Courtesy Bail Notice. You will be required to appear in court before paying your fine.</p>

<p>If you fail to appear in court by the due date indicated on your Courtesy Bail Notice and did not request an extension, you may be subject to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>An additional Failure to Appear charge which is a misdemeanor and punishable by a fine, or jail, or both.</li>
	<li>A civil assessment of up to&nbsp;$300.00 pursuant to PC1214.1.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the Department of Motor Vehicles may revoke or suspend your driver's license, and/or withhold its issuance or renewal.</p>

<strong>Non-Mandatory Appearance Violations</strong>

<p>If the Courtesy Bail Notice does not indicate Mandatory Appearance, your options are to:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Pay the traffic ticket</strong> prior to your required appearance date. The traffic ticket will remain on your driving record.</li>
	<li><strong>Attend Traffic School.</strong> Eligibility Requirements</li>
	<li><strong>Appear in Court</strong>. If you are unable to appear at the date and time indicated on your citation or Courtesy Notice, contact the traffic office for a single 30 day extension.</li>

https://www.slo.courts.ca.gov/dv/traffic.htm,"<p><strong>Your Rights</strong>

<p>As a defendant you have the following constitutional and statutory rights:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To be informed of the charges against you in open court.</li>
	<li>To be represented by a lawyer.</li>
</ul>

<p>(a) In infraction matters, you are not entitled to a court appointed lawyer, however you may hire your own lawyer.</p>

<p>(b) In misdemeanor matters, you may hire your own lawyer or if you cannot afford a lawyer, the court may appoint one for you at no initial cost. (However, the court may order reimbursement of costs according to your ability to pay.)</p>

<ul>
	<li>To a speedy and public trial within 45 days of arraignment, or a court trial in infraction cases</li>
	<li>To confront and cross-examine the witnesses against you.</li>
	<li>To put on a defense and as part of that defense to testify in your own behalf and to obtain a document (a subpoena) to compel witnesses to appear without expense to you. More information regarding subpoenas</li>
	<li>To remain silent and not to be called as a witness during your own court proceeding.</li>
	<li>To a court or jury trial in misdemeanor cases.</li>
	<li>To appeal if you are found guilty at a trial, provided you file your notice of appeal within 30 days and follow other court rules. Appeal Instructions CR-141<br/>
	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<strong>Pleading Not Guilty</strong>

<p>If you plead not guilty, you are telling the Court you want to contest the charge(s) against you. A contested trial will be scheduled within 45 days. You may waive your right to a speedy trial and have it scheduled within a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<p>While many individuals with a good record may be released on their promise to appear, the court may require bail to be posted to secure appearance at trial, particularly <strong>if you have previous failures to appear or pay.</strong></p>

<p>At your trial, the officer who issued the citation will testify as a witness. If there are other witnesses, they may also be called to testify.</p>

<p>At the trial you may question (cross-examine) the witnesses. You may testify yourself and / or call witnesses to testify.</p>

<p>After the evidence is presented the judge may rule immediately whether you are guilty or not guilty or the case may be taken under submission before deciding. If the case is taken under submission, you will be notified of the ruling by mail or you may choose to return to court.</p>

<p>If you are found not guilty, that is the end of the case. If you are found guilty, the judge will determine how much the fine will be. <strong>The fine may be more or less than the bail originally quoted in your case </strong>depending on the facts which were presented. If your driving record shows previous convictions, the fine may increase substantially and your driver's license may be suspended for up to 6 months.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Trials</strong>

<p><strong>Trial by Written Declaration</strong> – This option is for infraction violations only and does not require a personal appearance. You may request a Trial by Written Declaration which requires you to post bail in lieu of your appearance.</p>

<p>Instructions and forms for a Trial by Written Declaration may be obtained on our forms page, by mail, or in person. Submit the Trial by Written Declaration form with any facts or evidence you wish to have considered. A written statement will be requested from the citing officer(s). A judicial officer will review your case and you will be notified by mail of the decision</p>

<p><strong>Court Trial</strong> – This option requires a court appearance and is available for all violations.</p>

<p>A Court Trial requires you to post bail if you do not appear for arraignment. Posting bail pursuant to VC40519(b) constitutes a waiver of your right to a speedy trial within 45 days. Send a check or money order for the total bail or appear for an arraignment and enter your plea after which the court will set your trial date and notice you by mail. If you fail to appear at the time designated for your trial, either a trial in your absence will occur (Trial in Absentia), or a VC40508(a) misdemeanor charge may be added against you, which bears a $300.00 assessment and a driver’s license suspension until resolved.</p>

<p>For more information, see Pleading Not Guilty, above.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong> What is a Subpoena?</strong>

<p>A Subpoena is actually an order from the Court telling a person to either show up in court, or to bring something to court. When a Subpoena is directed to a person to appear in court, it is called a personal subpoena. When it is used to get a thing into court (like a photograph or sign), it is called a “Subpoena Duces Tecum” – which means, basically, Subpoena “bring with you”.</p>

<p>In CA there is a mandatory form for Criminal and Traffic Court subpoenas that is published by the Judicial Council Subpoena Form CR-125.</p>

<strong>What Sort of Things Does a Subpoena Work For?</strong>

<p>A Traffic Court Defendant in California can use a Subpoena to require any witness to appear in court. This includes police, bystanders who saw what happened, passengers, the person who maintains the machine, or the tow truck driver who impounded the car.</p>

<p>A Subpoena can also be used to get things into trial such as photos, maintenance records, radar guns, video recordings, paperwork, etc.</p>

<p>If you want to force a thing to come to court, you have to direct the subpoena to the “Custodian of Records” – or the person who is known to have possession or control over the item. Most large businesses and government agencies (including the CHP) have a person designated as the “Custodian of Records” who is responsible for responding to subpoenas.</p>

<strong>How Does a Defendant Representing Themselves Get a Subpoena Issued?</strong>

<p>In cases where a defendant represents themselves, (called “pro per”), the Defendant has the right to use a Subpoena, but they must get the court clerk to sign the completed Subpoena Form.</p>

<p>You can download the Judicial Council Subpoena Form CR-125. Then fill in as much information as possible and take it in person to the clerk’s office for issuance. Once there, tell the clerk that you need to get the subpoena issued, give them the form&nbsp;and ask for a signature and stamp.</p>

<strong>Once a Subpoena is Issued by the Court Clerk, It Must Be Personally Served on the Witness or Custodian.</strong>

<p>To be enforceable, a Subpoena must be personally handed to the person it is directed to. Defendants cannot serve the Subpoena themselves. There must be an Independent Person to Serve the Subpoena such as the Sheriff’s Department Process Service.</p>

<p>Once a Subpoena is served, the server must fill out the attached “Proof of Service” so the service can be verified in court.</p>

<p></p></p>",Contesting a Citation,
https://www.slo.courts.ca.gov/dv/traffic.htm,"<p>
<strong>How do I set a court date?</strong>

<p>If you wish to appear before a judge or court commissioner, you must check in with the clerk in the Traffic Department at the&nbsp;location indicated on your citation, no later than the appearance date stated, to be placed on the court calendar. <em>If you are under 18 years of age, your case is&nbsp;automatically set on calendar. No check-in is required. Your appearance location and time should be noted on the bottom of your citation. </em></p>

<p>Your appearance date, place, and time are indicated on your copy of the citation, and on your courtesy bail notice. (The officer who issued your citation will not be present.)</p>

<p>If your citation has been filed with the court by the citing agency, you may appear prior to your due date that is noted on the bottom of your citation.</p>

<p>Shorts, tank tops, bare feet, and other inappropriate attire are not allowed in the courtroom.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Appearing in Court</strong>

<p>When you appear in traffic court, the first appearance is for <strong>Arraignment</strong>, which is when you enter a plea.</p>

<p>The judge will ask that you step before the bench and confirm your understanding of the charges. If you do not understand, the charges and the potential consequences in the event of conviction will be read to you. Thereafter, you are asked which plea you want to enter.</p>

<p>There are several pleas you can enter; the most common are:</p>

<strong>Guilty Plea</strong>

<p>If you plead guilty you can give the judge an explanation about what happened.</p>

<p>If the judicial officer reduces your fine, he or she can order it be paid immediately, and, considering your prior convictions and any facts in aggravation, can increase the fine over the bail amount.</p>

<strong>No Contest Plea</strong>

<p>This is the same as a guilty plea <em>except </em>if you are involved in a civil suit (arising from your actions the citation was issued for) - such as a traffic accident - a no contest plea cannot be used against you in a later civil proceeding.</p>

<p>If the judicial officer reduces your fine, he or she can order it be paid immediately, and, considering your prior convictions and any facts in aggravation, can increase the fine over the bail amount.</p>

<strong>Not Guilty Plea</strong>

<p>The judge will order your case scheduled for&nbsp;trial to determine your innocence or guilt. <strong>You will be notified by mail of your court trial date and time to appear. It is your responsibility to assure that the court does have your correct mailing address and a phone number&nbsp;where you can be contacted. </strong></p>

<p>You may not give an explanation at arraignment since the facts will be covered at your trial.</p>

<strong>Appearing in Court on a Failure to Appear</strong>

<p>If your case is in a Failure to Appear status, you may contact the court for appearance location, dates and times that you may appear on your case. If you have relevant documentation to show the Traffic Commissioner such as proof of correction, a doctor’s note, proof of incarceration, death certificate, or proof of financial situation, please bring that with you to court.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Conduct During Court Proceedings</strong>

<p>During court you are expected to sit quietly and refrain from talking, chewing gum, reading newspapers, or other behavior that would distract the court and others.</p>

<p>Shorts, tank tops, and other inappropriate attire are not permitted and you will not be allowed to appear if so dressed. Hats are not to be worn in the courtroom. No food, drinks, or weapons of any kind are allowed in the courtroom.</p>

<p>Pagers, telephones, and other audible electronic devices are to be turned off or made silent before entering the courtroom.</p>

https://www.slo.courts.ca.gov/sh/selfhelp-criminallaw.htm,,Criminal Case Information Requests,
https://www.slo.courts.ca.gov/sh/selfhelp-criminallaw.htm,"<p>If you have an outstanding warrant there are several general options to handle your situation:&nbsp; Post bail; Turn yourself in to Law Enforcement;&nbsp;calendar your case for court (Court Surrender.)&nbsp; Not all options are available for all warrants. &nbsp;Please see the details below or contact the court to determine which options apply to your warrant.&nbsp; Be prepared to provide a name and case number or a name and date of birth for all warrant inquiries.

<p>San Luis Obispo,&nbsp;Grover Beach&nbsp;or Paso Robles cases: (805) 781-5670<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>turning yourself in to law enforcement</strong>

<p>You may turn yourself in to the San Luis Obispo County Jail or any California Law Enforcement agency.&nbsp; If your warrant is a Felony, you may be able to turn yourself in to Law Enforcement in another state.&nbsp; If you turn yourself in, you will be taken in to custody and transported to the San Luis Obispo County Jail, where you will be held until your court date.&nbsp; If you are released from jail/custody and given a court date, it is your responsibility to appear or arrange for an attorney to appear for you on this date.&nbsp; No changes to this court date can be made.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Posting Bail on a Warrant</strong>

<p>If your warrant has a specific bail amount assigned, you may post bail to clear&nbsp;your warrant and receive a court date.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may post bail at the court or at any law enforcement agency.&nbsp; If your warrant states ""NO&nbsp;BAIL"", then this is not an option for this case.</p>

<strong>Cash Bail</strong>

<p>Bail can be posted at the Court using cash, credit card, money order, cashier's check or personal check.&nbsp; This money will be processed and may be refunded at the conclusion of the case provided appearances are made as ordered by the court.&nbsp; Cash bail can also be ordered to apply to any fines that result on any case with this court.&nbsp; Law Enforcement agencies may not accept all of the above methods of payment for posting bail.&nbsp; Bail posted with personal funds in this manner is called Cash Bail.&nbsp; Once Cash Bail is posted, your warrant will be recalled (cleared) and you will be given a date to appear in court.&nbsp; It is your responsibility to appear or arrange for an attorney to appear for you on this date.&nbsp;This date cannot be changed.</p>

<strong>Bail Bond</strong>

<p>Bail can also be posted by contacting any bail bond company.&nbsp; Bail bond companies are private businesses who&nbsp;charge a fee to post a bail bond in the amount of your warrant.&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrangements made with bail bond companies are private business agreements.&nbsp;Once the bail bond is posted on your matter, the warrant will be recalled and you will be given a court date as&nbsp;assigned by the bail bond company.&nbsp; It is your responsibility to appear or arrange an attorney to appear for you on this date.&nbsp; No changes to this court date can be made.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Post and Forfeit Warrants</strong>

<p>On certain cases you can post the bail and forfeit it to close your case.&nbsp; This involves making a payment to the court.&nbsp; On eligible cases, once the money is received, the warrant will be recalled and your case closed.&nbsp; No court appearance will be required.&nbsp; To check if your warrant is eligible for Post and Forfeit, please contact the court.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Request Court Surrender/Calendar date</strong>

<p>If you have an outstanding warrant you or your attorney may request the clerk to calendar your warrant matter(s) for hearing&nbsp;by appearing&nbsp;at the Criminal counter in San Luis Obispo.&nbsp;&nbsp;Calendaring your case does NOT recall the warrant.&nbsp; Your warrant will be addressed by a judge on&nbsp;your court date. &nbsp;You can&nbsp;calendar your case&nbsp;by calling the&nbsp;court or by appearing&nbsp;at the clerk's counter&nbsp;during normal business hours. Our phones are open M-TH, Counters M-F 8:30AM - 4:00PM.&nbsp; The clerk will verify that your case qualifies for ""court surrender"" and will calendar your case for two weeks in the future on an appropriate court date.&nbsp; If your warrant is the result of a Prop 36 case, this option is not available to you.&nbsp; If your warrant was ordered as ""no court surrender"", this option is not available to you.&nbsp; To check if your warrant is for a Prop 36 case or states ""no court surrender"" please contact the court in person or by calling (805) 781-5670.</p></p>",Warrants,

<strong>Petition for Dismissal</strong>

<strong>(PC &sect;&sect; 17(b)/1203.4/1203.4a/1203.41)</strong>

<strong>Infraction OR Misdemeanor:</strong>

<p>To file a Petition for Dismissal, two separate Judicial Council forms are required: CR180 and CR181.&nbsp;&nbsp;to the San Luis Obispo branch:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Completed CR180 AND CR181 forms (one set for each case.) AND a completed Consent to Electronic Service and Notice of Electronic Service Address EFS-005-CV.&nbsp; In order for the court to notify you of the outcome you must include the Consent to Electronic Service and Notice of Electronic Service Address or a self-addressed stamped envelope.</li>
	<li>Information needed to complete your petition: Court case&nbsp;number, whether your sentence included probation or not, charge(s) you were convicted of and the conviction date. Please be aware that the conviction date is different from the violation date. This information can be obtained from your plea minute order, the&nbsp;case summary&nbsp;or by calling or visiting our Criminal Operations Clerk’s office.</li>
	<li>$60&nbsp;processing fee per case.</li>
	<li>AND a completed Consent to Electronic Service and Notice of Electronic Service Address EFS-005-CV. In order for the court to notify you of the outcome you must include the Consent to Electronic Service and Notice of Electronic Service Address or a self-addressed stamped envelope.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once submitted, the clerk will review the documents for completeness.&nbsp; If complete, the&nbsp;prosecuting attorney will be notified.&nbsp; The prosecuting attorney has 30 days to respond.&nbsp; After 30 days, the petition will be submitted to the assigned Bench Officer&nbsp;for review and signature.&nbsp; The clerk will notify you of the Bench Officer's decision by mail&nbsp;with a certified copy if you provided a self-address stamped envelope OR by email if you submitted the EFS-005-CV form.&nbsp; If you neglect to submit a self-addressed stamped envelope or the EFS-005-CV form, no notification will be sent.</p>

<p>Pursuant to Local Rule 10.17(1), these matters area always initially handled ex parte (by submission of the forms, without a court hearing.)&nbsp; Matters will be placed on calendar only by order of the reviewing bench officer.</p>

<p>The juvenile courts have the ability to intervene in three different types of circumstances:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Delinquents&nbsp;are persons under 18 years of age who have committed an illegal act which, if committed by an adult, would be considered a criminal offense, such as a felony or misdemeanor. (Welfare &amp; Institutions Code &sect;602.)</li>
	<li>Status offenders&nbsp;are minors who have committed offenses which are only illegal due to their age and would not be considered illegal if committed by adults. Examples: truancy, running away from home etc. (Welfare &amp; Institutions Code &sect;601.)</li>
	<li>Dependent children&nbsp;are those who have been abused, neglected or abandoned. (Welfare &amp; Institutions Code &sect;300.) The juvenile court must decide who will be responsible for the care of these children.<br/>
	&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>To assist parents of minor age children in reorganizing their family following separation or divorce in a manner that will enable the children to continue having healthy relationships with both parents.</p>

<strong>Mediation</strong>

<p>Mediation is required by California State law when parents are in disagreement about the custody of their child/ren. Mediation is a process of assisting parents in developing a parenting plan and is a neutral setting for discussing arrangements for the children, and to reduce acrimony and provide guidelines for parenting after separation or divorce. Mediation is a means of settling parenting disputes outside of court. Each parent is given the opportunity to be heard, and the objective is to develop parenting plans that meet the needs of the child/ren. Mediation is confidential from the Court process, and the mediator does not make recommendations to the Court if the parents are in disagreement. If an agreement is reached, the stipulation/agreement is submitted to the Court only after the parties have agreed in writing.</p>

<p>For more information regarding the procedures for scheduling a mediation appointment, contact Family Court Services between the hours of 8:30 am and 4 pm on Monday through Thursday at (805) 706-3608.</p>

<strong>Mediation by Phone</strong>

<p>Family Court Services can accommodate requests for long distance and out of state telephone mediation for parents who reside outside San Luis Obispo County. All telephone mediations must be approved by&nbsp;FCS prior to the scheduled appointment.&nbsp;<strong>For telephonic mediations a <em>Mediation Intake Form </em>(see below) must be received by the parent pre-approved to call in&nbsp;at least 24 hours prior to the appointment time.</strong></p>

<p>The intake form can be faxed to 805-706-0210 or mailed to the FCS address:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 901 Park Street<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paso Robles, CA, 93446</p>

<strong>Mediation is for parents only</strong>

<p>New spouses, significant other relationships and extended family members are not to be included unless previously approved by Family Court Services. Children are not included unless previously arranged by Family Court Services. Please contact FCS prior to your appointment if you wish to have a support person present because of domestic violence or if you have any questions about who is to attend mediation in your particular matter. <strong>Please do not bring your children to mediation. </strong></p>

<strong>Domestic Violence and Restraining Orders</strong>

<p>In cases involving domestic violence, mediation is conducted in a manner to protect all the parties. Family Court Services' policy is to meet with each party separately. FCS schedules each appointment at separate times. FCS's goal is to protect all parties during the mediation experience in order to create the best possible environment to help families develop parenting plans with as little conflict as possible and with the highest level of satisfaction possible.</p>

<strong>Child Custody Evaluations</strong>

<p><strong>REGISTRO:&nbsp; </strong>Llame a la oficina de antemano a los Servicios de la Corte de Relaciones Familiares para registrarse y obtener informacion, al numero 805-226-3251.&nbsp; Debe tener disponible el numero del caso civil o del divorcio para darselo al secretario.&nbsp; Clases en espanol son ofrecidas, y son citadas de acuerdo con los registrados.</p>

<p><strong>COSTO:</strong>&nbsp; gratis</p>

<p>Este programa satisface los requisitos del programa de educacion antes de que se le otorga las ordenes judiciales para finalizar el caso.</p>


<p>In cases with ongoing unresolved disputes between parents, the Court&nbsp;may order a&nbsp;child custody evaluation. The evaluation is conducted by a court appointed evaluator. The focus of a child custody evaluation is to assess the individual and family factors that affect the best interests of the child/ren. The primary purpose and function of a child custody evaluation is to gather information about the family in a comprehensive and unbiased manner, and to report back to the court with a recommendation for a parenting plan that will help the child/ren maintain relationships with both parents&nbsp;in a manner that&nbsp;best serves his/her needs.</p>

<p>To accomplish this end, a child custody evaluation usually includes (1) an assessment of each parent's historical involvement and current capacities for parenting and their ability to manage conflict; (2) an assessment of the child's functioning and developmental needs and the child's wishes where appropriate; and (3) an assessment of each parent's functional ability to meet the child's needs, which includes evaluation of the interaction between each adult and child.</p>

<p>Some evaluations are much more limited in scope than others. This will be described in the evaluation order. Your evaluator will review the process for your family during your first appointment with them.</p>

<p>If a custody evaluation is ordered by the court for your family, please be sure to read through the order carefully.&nbsp; We need your help to get things started, and the order will give you directions on how to proceed.&nbsp; Contact Family Court Services with any questions at 805-706-3608.</p>

<p>With an ordered custody evaluation only,&nbsp;we require that each parent fill out the following forms and deliver them to Family Court Services:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Family Court Services Intake Form&nbsp;(AKA: Custody evaluation personal data sheet)</li>
	<li>Release of Information
	​<strong>NOTE:</strong> For full evaluations, please complete a release of information form for each treatment professional who is working with or has recently worked with you and your children (IE: schools, therapists, pediatricians). For partial evaluations you only need to complete release of information forms for those professionals outlined in your order.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>If the court has ordered that the evaluation only consist of interviewing your children, then you will need to turn in the following form&nbsp;to Family Court Services instead of the forms outlined above:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Child interview parent questionnaire<br/>

            <p>A pension can be more valuable than any other asset acquired during the marriage or domestic partnership, including a house. It may be worth more than all of the other assets put together.&nbsp; There are very specific and technical rules that apply to pensions and you should get legal advice from a lawyer in order to protect your interest in the pension.&nbsp; In some cases, a pension plan must be “joined” as a party in your divorce case before a judge will issue an order about how the pension will be divided. Read the Retirement Plan Joinder - Information Sheet<em> </em>(FL-318-INFO) for more information about whether the pension plan must be joined in your divorce case.&nbsp; The court order that details how a pension will be divided is called a qualified domestic relations order, or QDRO. The QDRO must be approved by both the benefits provider and the judge to assure that the spouse/partner that is not the employee of the company or organization will receive those future benefits. A QDRO is an extremely complicated legal document and if you make a mistake, there can be harmful results.</p>

<p>Contact the Civil Department at (805)706-3600. Have your case number ready and tell the clerk you need to schedule a <strong>Judicial Mediation</strong>. Judicial Mediation can only be requested <em>in court</em>, must be <em>ordered by the judge</em>, and is only allowed for <em>unlimited cases</em>. If your case number starts with an <strong>LC</strong> you’ll need to contact a private mediator.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>


<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>

<p>If your case has recently been filed, please refer to your Case Management Order. You'll note that early mediation is strongly encouraged and that the court will typically&nbsp;provide&nbsp;an order to mediate at an early case management conference.</p>

<p>If you've had your case management conference, you may already have a <strong>Mediation Order</strong>. This order provides a deadline by which you must have completed mediation, as well as information on who must be present for the mediation session. Scheduling can take time. Contact a mediator (or the civil department if you have been ordered to Judicial Mediation) to schedule your mediation session well ahead of time or you may miss your deadline.&nbsp;Reviewing our court's Local Rules may also be helpful.</p>


<p>Benefits to Mediation</p></p>",Mediation Appointments,
https://www.slo.courts.ca.gov/dv/civil.htm,"<p>ADR is an acronym for “Alternative Dispute Resolution”. ADR programs provide alternative ways to resolve your dispute. Generally, these include using a neutral third party to help you find a resolution. While the court may be considered the original “neutral third party”, most people find litigation (court procedures) to be time consuming, stressful, and expensive. ADR programs are here to offer you an option that can bring closure more efficiently and in some ways, more effectively.

<p>San Luis Obispo County Superior Court ADR programs include Mediation and Arbitration. View&nbsp;a list of the mediators that can be found in the Mediation Binders located in all civil courtrooms.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Mediation</strong>

<p>Mediation is fair, voluntary, confidential, and flexible. Choosing mediation allows you to try and resolve the situation based on what’s most important to you.The mediator facilitates a productive process to help break down the barriers in communication that often go up due to conflict, and to explore options allowing parties to arrive at a mutual, acceptable resolution.The mediator does not decide the dispute; the parties retain power over the outcome.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Arbitration</strong>

<p>Arbitration is normally an informal process in which a neutral person (the arbitrator) decides the dispute after hearing the evidence and arguments of the parties.The parties can agree to binding or non-binding arbitration.Binding arbitration is designed to give each side a resolution of their dispute when they cannot agree between themselves or with a mediator. If the arbitration is non-binding, any party can reject the arbitrator’s decision and request a trial. Generally arbitration must be ordered by the court. In San Luis Obispo Superior Court if there is an order for non-binding arbitration, arrangements are made through Jury Services.</p>

<strong>What are the potential advantages of ADR?</strong>

<ul>
	<li>ADR can <strong>save time and money</strong>. ADR, especially when used early in a dispute, can save a lot of time and money. Even when ADR does not result in an immediate resolution, it can produce savings by clarifying and narrowing the scope of the dispute.</li>
	<li>ADR provides <strong>increased flexibility and control</strong>. ADR typically gives you greater flexibility and control in the dispute resolution process - in the procedures followed, the interests considered and the remedies adopted - than you would have in a court trial. In mediation, for example, you can work out a resolution that may not be available in court.</li>
	<li>ADR is generally <strong>confidential</strong>. Confidentiality encourages openness and candor, and is considered an important factor in the effectiveness of ADR.</li>
	<li>ADR can <strong>improve communication and preserve relationships</strong>. Some ADR processes are designed to reduce the hostility created by the dispute and to help each side communicate with the other. This is particularly true of mediation. The aim of mediation is to create a cooperative atmosphere in which both sides can find ""win-win"" solutions that will preserve or improve, rather than further damage, the relationship.</li>
	<li>ADR can give you <strong>a chance to tell your side of the story</strong>. Some ADR processes will permit you to tell your side of the story in a way that cannot be done in court. This opportunity for both sides to be heard can make the difference between a satisfying or frustrating dispute resolution process.</li>
	<li>ADR can <strong>reduce stress and increase satisfaction</strong>. Litigation can be highly stressful. Lack of control over the process and outcome, prolonged uncertainty and mounting costs all contribute to such stress. The benefits of many ADR processes - reduced expense, confidentiality, a quicker process, an out-of-court setting and greater control for those involved, for example - often make them less stressful.</li>

https://www.slo.courts.ca.gov/sh/selfhelp-divorce-defaulthearing.htm,"<p><strong>1. Status of Marriage</strong>

<p>Standard: Irreconcilable differences have arisen.&nbsp; If you were married, then the judge will want to know if “irreconcilable differences have arisen leading to the irremediable breakdown of the marriage.” This means that there has been a breakdown of the marriage and that no amount of counseling will reunite the two of you.&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>2. Child Custody and Visitation</strong>

<p>Standard:&nbsp; Best Interest of Child.&nbsp; If there are minor children of the marriage, then you will want to explain to the judge what you want and why.&nbsp; If you are requesting no or supervised visitation don’t forget to tell the judge why you believe your proposal is in the best interests of the child or children.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>3. Child Support / Health insurance / Child Care</strong>

<p>Main Factors to Determine Child Support:&nbsp; Dad’s Income, Mom’s Income, Percentage of Time each Parent.</p>

<p>If you are going to request a specific amount of child support at your default hearing, you may have the Self-Help Center / Family Law Facilitator calculate the possible guideline child support amount or you may want to calculate it on your own at www.childsup.ca.gov.&nbsp; In order to calculate child support you should bring a copy of your FL-150 Income and Expense Declaration.&nbsp; Also, you will have to make an estimate for the judge as to the other parent’s gross income before taxes.&nbsp; If you tell the judge, “I don’t know what s/he makes,” then the judge will have a difficult time making an order.&nbsp; Remember, you know more about what the other parent earns or is able to earn than the judge does.&nbsp; For this reason, you can describe the other parent’s occupation, experience, etc., and let the judge know what you believe the other parent is capable of earning.&nbsp; The judge can then use this figure in setting the other parent’s earnings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At your hearing, you may also request an order that the other parent carry the minor children on health insurance available through the other parent’s employment even if they don’t have insurance now.&nbsp; Note that the judge may make the same order for you that each of you carry the children on insurance that is available at no or reasonable cost through your employment.&nbsp; You may also request that each parent pay one-half of any reasonable health care expenses that are not covered by the insurance.</p>

<p>If you incur child care expenses while you are at work or school, you may request that the other parent pay for one-half of any child care expenses incurred while you are at work or school.</p>

<p>If there is a case with the Department of Child Support Services, you will want to let the judge know this. Bring a copy of the child support order with you to your hearing. If the case is in another county, you will want to tell the judge the name of the other county where the DCSS case is located.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>4. Spousal Support</strong>

<p>Main Factors:&nbsp; Ability to Pay; Need for Support; Standard of Living During Marriage; Length of Marriage; Age and health of each spouse; How much income each can earn on their own; What the expenses of each spouse are; Whether there are minor children at home; The history of the way the couple handled money during the marriage; What each person needs; What each person pays or can pay (including earnings and earning capacity); Whether having a job would make it too hard to take care of the minor children; Debts and property; Whether one spouse or domestic partner helped the other get an education, training, career, or professional license; Whether there was domestic violence in the marriage or domestic partnership; Whether one spouse's, or domestic partner's, career was affected by unemployment, or by taking care of the children or home, and; The tax impact of spousal support.</p>

<p>If you want to request a specific amount of spousal support, you will need to tell the judge all the facts in your case that are related to the factors listed above.</p>

<p>If you do not ever want spousal support (now or in the future), then let the judge know you are “waiving” spousal support.&nbsp; If you waive spousal support, you will never be able to ask for spousal support in the future, even if you need it.&nbsp; If you have a marriage of 10 years or more the court will want you to explain why this is a reasonable request.</p>

<p>If you do not ever want to pay spousal support to the other party, then let the judge know that you want to “terminate jurisdiction” over the issue of spousal support.&nbsp; If you have a marriage of 10 years or more the court will want you to explain why this is a reasonable request.</p>

<p>If you want the court to make spousal support orders in the future, then let the judge know that you want to “reserve jurisdiction” over the issue of spousal support.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>5. Assets and Debts</strong>

<p>Standard: Equal Division of Community Property and Debt.&nbsp; Remember that community property is defined as any asset or debt that was purchased or incurred after date of marriage and before date of separation.&nbsp; There are some exceptions to this rule, such as gifts or inheritance.&nbsp; Generally, in a default hearing the court wants to be able to divide that community property assets and debts equally between the parties.</p>

<p>If there are assets or debts to be divided by the judge, you should review the FL-160 Property Declaration(s) that you previously completed.&nbsp; If you are requesting that the community property assets and debts be divided unequally, you will need to tell the judge why your unequal proposal for division is a fair and equitable division.</p>

<p>If you are requesting that the court divide a pension or retirement plan then you may need to seek legal advice from an attorney before you get divorced. In most cases, the pension plan will not be able to disburse any money until a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) is signed by the judge.&nbsp; In addition, if the employee spouse dies before a QDRO is signed then the pension will not pay out any money to the spouse.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>6. Restoring of your Former Name</strong>

<p>If you want the judge to order that your name be restored to your former name, be sure to request this at the time of your hearing.</p></p>",Finish a Divorce Case: Default Hearing Checklist,https://www.slo.courts.ca.gov/sh/selfhelp-glossary.htm

Civil Appeals,"<p><strong>What is an Appeal?</strong>

<p>An appeal is a request to a higher court to review a decision made by a lower court. An appeal is not a retrial or rehearing and new evidence cannot be introduced. The reviewing court can only determine if the lower court erred in rendering its decision.</p>

<p>Small Claims appeals are the exception. These appeals are scheduled for a new trial.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Who Can File an Appeal?</strong>

<p>In a Small Claims case, the defendant may file an appeal or the plaintiff may file an appeal on a defendant's claim.</p>

<p>In a limited or unlimited civil case, including domestic, probate and mental health, any party may file an appeal.</p>

<p>In an infractions, misdemeanor or felony case, the defendant may file an appeal. In certain circumstances, the People of the State of California may file an appeal.</p>

<p>A death penalty conviction is appealed automatically.</p>

<p>In a juvenile dependency or delinquency case, any party may file an appeal.</p>

<p>A party may represent him/her self (pro per) or select to be represented by an attorney. The party filing an appeal is called the Appellant. The party against whom an appeal is filed is called the Respondent.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>When to File an Appeal?</strong>

<p>Small Claims and Limited Civil appeals are filed within 30 days from the date of mailing of the Notice of Entry of Judgment.</p>

<p>Unlimited Civil appeals are filed within 60 days from the date of mailing of the Notice of Entry of<br/>
Judgment or if the notice is not mailed, 180 days from the date of entry of judgment.</p>

<p>Infractions and Misdemeanor appeals are filed within 30 days after the order or judgment.</p>

<p>Felony appeals are filed within 60 days from judgment.</p>

<p>Juvenile appeals are filed within 60 days after an appealable order or 60 days after the order becomes final under CRC 1417(c).</p>

<p>All days are calendar days unless otherwise specified as court days.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>What is the Filing Fee?</strong>

<p>No filing fee is charged for infraction, misdemeanor or juvenile appeals. Check the current Schedule of Fees for other appeals fees.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>How to Appeal</strong>

<p>Notify the court in writing by filing a Notice of Appeal. Submit appropriate filing fees. If the party is indigent (in forma pauperis), an application for Waiver of Court Fees and Order for Waiver may be filed.</p>

<p>Documents may be filed on pleading paper or approved form, if available. Contact business offices for availability of forms and/or instructions.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

Traffic Tickets 101,"<p><strong>Your Courtesy Bail Notice</strong>

<p>The Court sends you a Courtesy Bail Notice once we receive your citation. (It may take an agency 2-3 weeks to get us your citation info.) The Courtesy Notice provides information about how to handle your ticket, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bail amount you owe</li>
	<li>Due date when payment must be made</li>
	<li>Traffic School eligibility criteria</li>
	<li>""Fix-It"" ticket information: how to clear a proof of correction violation</li>
	<li>Court appearances: where and when to report, should you choose to do so</li>
</ul>

<p>Take action on the citation by its listed due date. <strong>Not receiving your Courtesy Bail Notice is <em>not</em> a legal excuse</strong> for failing to resolve the citation on time. Allow 10 days for delivery and processing when submitting anything by mail.</p>

<p>The DMV may suspend your driver’s license if you <strong>fail to appear or take action</strong> by the citation's due date. This DMV hold will restrict your ability to renew your driver's license or attend traffic school.</p>

<p>The court may refer your case to collections which may&nbsp;add up to&nbsp;$300.00 in civil assessment fees if you fail to pay your fines on time.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Paying the Citation</strong>

<p>Financial Hardship or Ability to Pay</p>

<p>To ask the Court to consider your ability to pay due to financial hardship and decide whether to approve a reduced fine with a payment plan or community service, you may schedule an appearance in Court for arraignment without the deposit of bail by contacting the clerk's office.</p>

<p>Payment plans and Community Work service are available for fines ordered by the Court. You may contact the clerk's office by phone or email slotraffic@slo.courts.ca.gov for more information.</p>

<p>Methods of Payment</p>

<p>The Court accepts credit or debit cards (Visa, MasterCard, and Discover),&nbsp;personal checks, money orders, cashier’s checks, and cash</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Mail the payment</strong> (check or money order, <strong>do not mail cash</strong>) to the Traffic Processing Center:

	<ul>
		<li>Make the payment payable to the <em>SLO Superior Court</em>.</li>
		<li>Write your docket number on the check or money order. Your case number can be found at the top right-hand corner of your courtesy bail notice directly under the print date.</li>

<p>If you are wishing to post bail and contest your citation, you must contact the clerk's office prior to payment either by phone or by correspondence. Failure to contact the clerk's office prior to payment will result in your case being closed. This is ONLY necessary if you are intending on pleading NOT GUILTY.</p>

<p>If you have appeared in Court and were granted Traffic School with a new total amount due, that amount does reflect the&nbsp;Traffic School fee. Your case will or has been continued with a Traffic School due date.</p>

<p>NOTE: The Court's vendor&nbsp;charges an additional Administrative Fee on all credit card payments.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to make sure payment is actually received by the Court prior to your appearance date.</p>

<p><strong>A $30.00 charge will be added on all returned checks.</strong></p>

<strong>Paying Bail</strong>

<p>Bail&nbsp;is the dollar amount associated with the&nbsp;code section you were cited for noted on your citation.&nbsp;If you choose to pay the bail on the citation <em>without</em> going to your arraignment or trial, it is a bail forfeiture. The citation is deemed paid, and the resulting conviction will be reported to DMV if you were cited for a reportable violation. Some violations require a mandatory court appearance and cannot simply be paid.</p>

<p>If there are mechanical or insurance violations included in the citation, the Court requires you to submit proof of correction before any reduction in bail can be applied. If you do <em>not</em> provide proof of correction, the total bail amount must be paid. Proof may be submitted either by mail or in person.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Payment Alternatives</strong>

<p>For a person who wants <strong>community work service</strong> instead of paying a fine or for those who just want&nbsp;more time to pay, the clerk of the Court is authorized to accept a written plea of guilty at the&nbsp;counter (or by mail) and continue the case for payments. This procedure is known as a “<strong>Counter&nbsp;</strong><strong>Arraignment</strong>” and is designed to save time and effort of sitting through a court session. This option is&nbsp;also available for payment of Traffic School fees.</p>

<p>A defendant who enters a guilty plea in writing at the clerk’s office will be given the options to request a one-time 90 day extension for a $30 time extension fee or they may request monthly payments of $50/$100 per month for a $35 payment plan fee. This option is also available for Traffic School fees.</p>

<p>Fine can be satisfied by completing community work service or some combination of work and fine. There is a required minimum payment due when the Counter Arraignment is signed.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Proof of Correction</strong>

<p>How to obtain Proof of Correction for Mechanical, Registration, License and Insurance Violations (“fix-it tickets”):</p>

<p>The citing officer must allege on the citation that the violation is correctable. Violations marked with an asterisk on your courtesy bail notice designate correctable violations.</p>

<p><em>Advisement:</em><em> Fraudulent or altered documentation may be referred to the Office of the District Attorney for a full investigation and possible criminal prosecution. </em></p>

<p><em>A photo copy of the signed off citation is not acceptable; unless, the submitted citation is a copy with an original signature of Law Enforcement or DMV. </em></p>

<strong>Mechanical Violations</strong>

<p>Proof of correction violations (required under VC40610) will be dismissed once the following have occurred (if taken care of in a timely manner).</p>

<ol>
	<li>The item is corrected (e.g. the tail light is fixed).</li>
	<li>An authorized representative signs the citation or Courtesy Bail Notice certifying it was corrected.</li>
	<li>The signed citation is submitted with a mandatory Fix-it Fee to the court.</li>
</ol>

<p>Authorized representatives include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>All California Law Enforcement agencies</li>
	<li>Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)<br/>
	(for license and registration issues)</li>
	<li>Any Station in California licensed to inspect and certify for the violation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many agencies charge a fee to sign the cite; this is different than the&nbsp;State Administration&nbsp;Fix-it Fee&nbsp;required by the court.</p>

<p>If you are delinquent in appearing, proof of correction will probably not reduce the bail or fine.</p>

<strong>Registration and License Violations</strong>

<p>If you are charged with a violation of the registration law, you must show proof to the Court that the vehicle has been registered, junked, or receipted as planned non-operation <strong>after</strong> the date of citation. A&nbsp;$25 State Mandated Fix-it fee will also be due.&nbsp;If&nbsp;proof of Release of Liability is submitted and it&nbsp;is dated with DMV <strong>prior </strong>to the violation date the $25&nbsp;Fix-it Fee is waived.</p>

<p>You may have DMV ""Sign-Off"" the violation on the back of your citation or you may submit a copy of your registration, proof of your junked or dismantled vehicle or proof the vehicle has been placed in non-operational status ""Non-Op'd"".</p>

<p>If you are charged with a license violation you may have the DMV sign off the back of your citation or sign your Courtesy Bail Notice. You may also provide a copy of your driver's license to the court. <strong>Sign-off only qualifies if the violation is filed as an ""infraction"" and the citing officer allows for correction. </strong></p>

<strong>Insurance Violations</strong>

<p>If you were charged with a violation of the proof of financial responsibility law (VC16028), the Court will dismiss the charge only if it is shown that the defendant was financially responsible (i.e. there was an insurance policy that covered the defendant/driver <strong>on the date of violation, or proof&nbsp;the the vehicle was insured at the time of the violation)</strong>. A Fixit-Fee is payable to the Court.</p>

<p>If you purchase a 6 month insurance policy&nbsp;<strong>after </strong>the violation date and <strong>your name </strong>is on the policy, the court will suspend half of the bail amount due that carries with that violation (VC16028(a)).</p>

<p><em>Advisement: </em><em>Fraudulent or altered documentation may be referred to the Office of the District Attorney for a full investigation and possible criminal prosecution</em></p>

<strong>What if I no longer own the vehicle or it is inoperable?</strong>

<p>If you no longer own the vehicle or it is inoperable, it is still your responsibility to clear the citation by either paying the bail or appearing in court. If you have junked the car or it is deemed inoperable, you will need to show proof of a DMV junk certificate or planned non-operation receipt to the Court. A Fixit-Fee is payable to the Court. (if applicable)</p>

<strong>Am I responsible for an equipment violation on a car I am driving that is not mine?</strong>

<p>Yes, unless the ticket is issued in the name of the registered owner of the vehicle you are driving. It is not an excuse that it was not your vehicle; it is still your responsibility to clear the citation if the citation is issued in your name.<br/>

        <p><strong>General Jury Service Information</strong>

<p>Jury service is mandatory. Prospective juror names are obtained from voter registration and DMV records.&nbsp;By law, prospective jurors are randomly chosen and because of this, we regret that we cannot accept volunteers for jury duty.</p>

<p>Normally, service may be required as often as once per year. Service lasts from one day to the length of the trial, starting at 8:00am and ending at 5:00pm. <strong>Business attire is suggested. No tank tops, shorts, bare midriffs, or bare feet are permitted in the courtroom.</strong></p>

<p>When entering any court facility all persons are subject to <strong>screening through a security device</strong>. You will walk through a metal detector and your handbags, briefcases, backpacks and containers may be X-rayed. Weapons of any type will not be permitted into any court facility. Items such as: knives (including pocket knives), guns, stun guns, pepper spray, mace, scissors, knitting needles, corkscrews, or any item that may be used as a weapon are not permitted. All weapons are prohibited and it is a felony to bring them into court buildings. <strong>Please allow extra time</strong> for this screening process.</p>

<p>Often students, teachers, physicians and small business owners and others with unusual schedules think that they are exempt from serving on jury duty. We cannot exempt or excuse you; however you are eligible for a onetime postponement for up to 6 months.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Rescheduling Jury Service</strong>

<p><strong>Excuse or postponement request <em>must</em> be received by Jury Services prior to your summons date.</strong></p>

<p>Jury service may be postponed one time for up to 6 months. There are no permanent excuses to jury service except verified medical illness. If approved for postponement you will receive a new summons for that date or the closest one available approximately 4&nbsp;weeks before your new appearance date.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Payment for Service</strong>

<p>Pursuant to section 230a of the Labor Code, your employer cannot prevent you from serving as a juror and is not required to pay you while on jury duty. However, the Superior Court will pay you $15.00 per day starting with your second day of service, plus mileage.<br/>

<strong>Parking Validation</strong>

<p>Jury Services validates parking <em><strong>only</strong></em> at the parking structure at 842 Palm Street, across from the Palm Theatre.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Take the ticket from the dispenser when entering.</li>
	<li>Bring that ticket into Jury Services for validation on each day of appearance.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Street Parking</strong>

<p>You may park for free on the street - in a two hour or more space - <em><strong>only</strong></em> if you cannot use the garage because:</p>

<ul>
	<li>you're in an oversized vehicle,</li>
	<li>you rode a motorcycle,</li>
	<li>or the parking garage is full.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the <strong><em>only</em></strong> reasons you will be allowed to park on the street, and only in a two hour or more space. If one of these situations does not apply to you, you may receive a parking ticket.</p>

<p>Place your juror parking card (located on the top of your summons) on your dashboard - the summons date and juror badge number must visible. You do <em>not</em> need to put money in the meter.</p>

<p>The summons date <strong>must</strong> be a current date. If it is not a current date, go into Jury Services and request an updated form for your dash. This updated form must be placed on your dash so you do not receive a parking ticket.</p>

Probate,"<p><strong>General Information</strong>

<p>Probate is the court-supervised process for identifying and gathering a decedent’s assets, paying taxes, debts, and expenses and distributing the balance to beneficiaries.</p>

<p>A conservatorship is a court proceeding where a judge appoints a responsible person or organization to care for another adult who cannot care for him/herself or his/her finances.</p>

<p>Before letters of conservatorship can be issued by the clerk, a proposed conservator must view a video and have read the <em>Handbook for Conservators</em>, now available online.</p>

<p>Guardianships are protective proceedings where the court gives a responsible person the custody of a minor or power to manage the minor’s property, or both.</p>

<p>The forms to initiate a guardianship case are available in our Guardianship self-help page.</p>

<p><strong>Wills -</strong> The clerk's office will accept wills after the person who wrote it is deceased. There is a $50 fee for lodging a will with the court.</p>

<p>The following applies to wills, trusts, conservatorships and guardianships:</p>

<p>The filing fee for a petition for probate is listed on the court’s fee schedule.</p>

<strong>Probate Appeals</strong>

<p>In an appeal, a higher court reviews the order or judgment of a lower court. Any party may appeal from an unfavorable decision based upon whether there was enough evidence to support the judgment or whether errors of law were committed during or before trial which harmed the appealing party.</p>

<p>The fee for filing an appeal on a Superior Court decision is $775.00. The clerks do not have forms for filing an appeal.</p>

<p>On a decision of the Superior Court, the notice of appeal must be filed within 60 days after the mailing or personal service of the entry of judgment. If a Notice has not been mailed or personally served, the appeal period is 180 days from the entry of judgment by the court. Permission to file late is rarely given. Filing of a notice of appeal does not stop enforcement of the judgment. You must still comply with all court orders.<br/>

        <p><strong>What are the types of Juvenile cases heard by the Court?</strong>

<p>The juvenile courts have the ability to intervene in three different types of circumstances:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Delinquents&nbsp;are persons under 18 years of age who have committed an illegal act which, if committed by an adult, would be considered a criminal offense, such as a felony or misdemeanor. (Welfare &amp; Institutions Code &sect;602.)</li>
	<li>Status offenders&nbsp;are minors who have committed offenses which are only illegal due to their age and would not be considered illegal if committed by adults. Examples: truancy, running away from home etc. (Welfare &amp; Institutions Code &sect;601.)</li>
	<li>Dependent children&nbsp;are those who have been abused, neglected or abandoned. (Welfare &amp; Institutions Code &sect;300.) The juvenile court must decide who will be responsible for the care of these children.<br/>
	&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

Family,"<p><strong>Mission</strong>

<p>To assist parents of minor age children in reorganizing their family following separation or divorce in a manner that will enable the children to continue having healthy relationships with both parents.</p>

<strong>Mediation</strong>

<p>Mediation is required by California State law when parents are in disagreement about the custody of their child/ren. Mediation is a process of assisting parents in developing a parenting plan and is a neutral setting for discussing arrangements for the children, and to reduce acrimony and provide guidelines for parenting after separation or divorce. Mediation is a means of settling parenting disputes outside of court. Each parent is given the opportunity to be heard, and the objective is to develop parenting plans that meet the needs of the child/ren. Mediation is confidential from the Court process, and the mediator does not make recommendations to the Court if the parents are in disagreement. If an agreement is reached, the stipulation/agreement is submitted to the Court only after the parties have agreed in writing.</p>

<p>For more information regarding the procedures for scheduling a mediation appointment, contact Family Court Services between the hours of 8:30 am and 4 pm on Monday through Thursday at (805) 706-3608.</p>

<strong>Mediation by Phone</strong>

<p>Family Court Services can accommodate requests for long distance and out of state telephone mediation for parents who reside outside San Luis Obispo County. All telephone mediations must be approved by&nbsp;FCS prior to the scheduled appointment.&nbsp;<strong>For telephonic mediations a <em>Mediation Intake Form </em>(see below) must be received by the parent pre-approved to call in&nbsp;at least 24 hours prior to the appointment time.</strong></p>

<p>The intake form can be faxed to 805-706-0210 or mailed to the FCS address:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Family Court Services</strong><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 901 Park Street<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paso Robles, CA, 93446</p>

<strong>Mediation is for parents only</strong>

<p>New spouses, significant other relationships and extended family members are not to be included unless previously approved by Family Court Services. Children are not included unless previously arranged by Family Court Services. Please contact FCS prior to your appointment if you wish to have a support person present because of domestic violence or if you have any questions about who is to attend mediation in your particular matter. <strong>Please do not bring your children to mediation. </strong></p>

<strong>Domestic Violence and Restraining Orders</strong>

<p>In cases involving domestic violence, mediation is conducted in a manner to protect all the parties. Family Court Services' policy is to meet with each party separately. FCS schedules each appointment at separate times. FCS's goal is to protect all parties during the mediation experience in order to create the best possible environment to help families develop parenting plans with as little conflict as possible and with the highest level of satisfaction possible.</p>

<strong>Child Custody Evaluations</strong>

<p><strong>COSTO:</strong>&nbsp; gratis</p>

<p>Este programa satisface los requisitos del programa de educacion antes de que se le otorga las ordenes judiciales para finalizar el caso.</p>


<p>In cases with ongoing unresolved disputes between parents, the Court&nbsp;may order a&nbsp;child custody evaluation. The evaluation is conducted by a court appointed evaluator. The focus of a child custody evaluation is to assess the individual and family factors that affect the best interests of the child/ren. The primary purpose and function of a child custody evaluation is to gather information about the family in a comprehensive and unbiased manner, and to report back to the court with a recommendation for a parenting plan that will help the child/ren maintain relationships with both parents&nbsp;in a manner that&nbsp;best serves his/her needs.</p>

<p>To accomplish this end, a child custody evaluation usually includes (1) an assessment of each parent's historical involvement and current capacities for parenting and their ability to manage conflict; (2) an assessment of the child's functioning and developmental needs and the child's wishes where appropriate; and (3) an assessment of each parent's functional ability to meet the child's needs, which includes evaluation of the interaction between each adult and child.</p>

<p>Some evaluations are much more limited in scope than others. This will be described in the evaluation order. Your evaluator will review the process for your family during your first appointment with them.</p>

<p>If a custody evaluation is ordered by the court for your family, please be sure to read through the order carefully.&nbsp; We need your help to get things started, and the order will give you directions on how to proceed.&nbsp; Contact Family Court Services with any questions at 805-706-3608.</p>

<p>With an ordered custody evaluation only,&nbsp;we require that each parent fill out the following forms and deliver them to Family Court Services:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Family Court Services Intake Form&nbsp;(AKA: Custody evaluation personal data sheet)</li>
	<li>Release of Information
	​<strong>NOTE:</strong> For full evaluations, please complete a release of information form for each treatment professional who is working with or has recently worked with you and your children (IE: schools, therapists, pediatricians). For partial evaluations you only need to complete release of information forms for those professionals outlined in your order.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>If the court has ordered that the evaluation only consist of interviewing your children, then you will need to turn in the following form&nbsp;to Family Court Services instead of the forms outlined above:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Child interview parent questionnaire<br/>

Domestic Violence,"<p>A domestic violence restraining order is a court order that helps protect people from abuse.<br/>
&nbsp;

<strong>Getting a Restraining Order</strong>

<strong>What is abuse?</strong>

<p>Abuse means to hit, hurt, scare, throw things, pull hair, push, follow, harass, sexually assault, stalking, or threaten to do any of these things.</p>

<strong>Can I get a restraining order?</strong>

<p>You may obtain a domestic violence restraining order if a person has abused you and you have a close relationship with that person (married or registered domestic partners, divorced, separated, dating or used to date), or you are related (parent, child, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, in-law).</p>

<p>If you are being harassed by roommates, neighbors, co-workers or other people not close to you, then you may request a Civil Harassment Restraining Order, not a Domestic Violence Restraining Order.</p>

<strong>What facts does the judge need to know about?</strong>

<p>Your written declaration must state sufficient detailed facts that show reasonable proof of a past act or acts of abuse.&nbsp; Your written declaration should contain dates, a detailed description of the abuse and a detailed description of any injuries.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Do It Yourself</strong>

<p>We have a document preparation program available for you to use to complete the necessary domestic violence restraining order request and response forms. This program will ask you to answer questions that are needed to complete the forms. The answers you give will be used to complete the forms needed. This program will also allow you to print out all the completed necessary forms. You may choose between two programs. The eFile option will allow you to eFile or print and file. The Print and File option will not allow you to eFile.</p>

<p>San Luis Obispo,&nbsp;Grover Beach&nbsp;or Paso Robles cases: (805) 781-5670<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>turning yourself in to law enforcement</strong>

<p>You may turn yourself in to the San Luis Obispo County Jail or any California Law Enforcement agency.&nbsp; If your warrant is a Felony, you may be able to turn yourself in to Law Enforcement in another state.&nbsp; If you turn yourself in, you will be taken in to custody and transported to the San Luis Obispo County Jail, where you will be held until your court date.&nbsp; If you are released from jail/custody and given a court date, it is your responsibility to appear or arrange for an attorney to appear for you on this date.&nbsp; No changes to this court date can be made.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Posting Bail on a Warrant</strong>

<p>If your warrant has a specific bail amount assigned, you may post bail to clear&nbsp;your warrant and receive a court date.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may post bail at the court or at any law enforcement agency.&nbsp; If your warrant states ""NO&nbsp;BAIL"", then this is not an option for this case.</p>

<strong>Cash Bail</strong>

<p>Bail can be posted at the Court using cash, credit card, money order, cashier's check or personal check.&nbsp; This money will be processed and may be refunded at the conclusion of the case provided appearances are made as ordered by the court.&nbsp; Cash bail can also be ordered to apply to any fines that result on any case with this court.&nbsp; Law Enforcement agencies may not accept all of the above methods of payment for posting bail.&nbsp; Bail posted with personal funds in this manner is called Cash Bail.&nbsp; Once Cash Bail is posted, your warrant will be recalled (cleared) and you will be given a date to appear in court.&nbsp; It is your responsibility to appear or arrange for an attorney to appear for you on this date.&nbsp;This date cannot be changed.</p>

<strong>Bail Bond</strong>

<p>Bail can also be posted by contacting any bail bond company.&nbsp; Bail bond companies are private businesses who&nbsp;charge a fee to post a bail bond in the amount of your warrant.&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrangements made with bail bond companies are private business agreements.&nbsp;Once the bail bond is posted on your matter, the warrant will be recalled and you will be given a court date as&nbsp;assigned by the bail bond company.&nbsp; It is your responsibility to appear or arrange an attorney to appear for you on this date.&nbsp; No changes to this court date can be made.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Post and Forfeit Warrants</strong>

<p>On certain cases you can post the bail and forfeit it to close your case.&nbsp; This involves making a payment to the court.&nbsp; On eligible cases, once the money is received, the warrant will be recalled and your case closed.&nbsp; No court appearance will be required.&nbsp; To check if your warrant is eligible for Post and Forfeit, please contact the court.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Request Court Surrender/Calendar date</strong>

<p>If you have an outstanding warrant you or your attorney may request the clerk to calendar your warrant matter(s) for hearing&nbsp;by appearing&nbsp;at the Criminal counter in San Luis Obispo.&nbsp;&nbsp;Calendaring your case does NOT recall the warrant.&nbsp; Your warrant will be addressed by a judge on&nbsp;your court date. &nbsp;You can&nbsp;calendar your case&nbsp;by calling the&nbsp;court or by appearing&nbsp;at the clerk's counter&nbsp;during normal business hours. Our phones are open M-TH, Counters M-F 8:30AM - 4:00PM.&nbsp; The clerk will verify that your case qualifies for ""court surrender"" and will calendar your case for two weeks in the future on an appropriate court date.&nbsp; If your warrant is the result of a Prop 36 case, this option is not available to you.&nbsp; If your warrant was ordered as ""no court surrender"", this option is not available to you.&nbsp; To check if your warrant is for a Prop 36 case or states ""no court surrender"" please contact the court in person or by calling (805) 781-5670.</p></p>",https://www.slo.courts.ca.gov/sh/selfhelp-criminallaw.htm,

Request for Order,"<p><strong>REGULAR REQUEST vs. EX PARTE REQUEST</strong>

<p>If you have a family law case opened, you may file a Request for Order&nbsp;to obtain temporary orders or modify court orders.&nbsp; Types of family law cases that you may file a Request for Order&nbsp;into include: Divorce, Legal Separation, Nullity, Petition to Establish Parental Relationship, Petition for Custody and Support, Local Child Support Agency - Complaint Regarding Parental Obligations and Domestic Violence Prevention Act.&nbsp; You may request a hearing in any of these cases.&nbsp; A Request for Order&nbsp;is an optional step and is not required to obtain a final judgment in your dissolution of marriage, legal separation, nullity or paternity case.</p>

<p>If you do not have a family law case opened, you may not file a Request for Order.&nbsp; To&nbsp;learn more about how to open a family law case you may&nbsp;click on a type of case listed above or&nbsp;visit the Self-Help Center / Family Law Facilitator Office.</p>

<p>Generally, you will obtain a hearing date within 30 days from the date you file your Request for Order documents. If you have an emergency and need emergency temporary orders before your hearing date in 30 days, then you may consider filing an Ex Parte Request for Order. An Ex Parte&nbsp;Request for Order&nbsp;requires additional forms and procedures from a regular Request for Order.</p>

<p>Ex Parte Request for Order&nbsp;are for emergencies only. Generally, an emergency is when there is or likely will be “blood on the floor.” This means that there is actual harm taking place or it is likely that if the court does not make an emergency order there will be harm.</p>

Examples of emergencies are:

<ul>
	<li>The other parent has taken the child, threatened that he/she will leave the state and hide, and you actually believe that they will do so.&nbsp;You need an ex parte order that returns the child to you and prevents him from leaving the area with the child.</li>
	<li>Your child needs emergency medical treatment that requires both parents’ consent and the other side refuses to give consent.&nbsp;You need an ex parte order that allows you to have the authority to give consent.</li>
	<li>The other parent has just been charged with child abuse or child molestation of your child, and there is a visitation order in effect that allows visitation for the coming weekend.&nbsp;You need an ex parte order that prevents visitation pending a full hearing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unless there is a showing of immediate harm to the child or immediate risk that the child will be removed from the State of California, the judge may properly deny your request.<br/>

<p>The declaration is a persuasive document that provides the judge as much detail as you can give and is a very&nbsp;important part of your case.&nbsp;If you are requesting emergency ex parte orders, your declaration must explain what the emergency is. Your declaration must explain all the reasons the court should grant the orders you are requesting.</p>

<p>It is your job to give the judge facts, details, dates, description of events, etc. so the judge can reach the conclusion that is most favorable to you. In your declaration, you must answer the question about why the judge should grant the orders you are requesting. On the day of the hearing, you may forget to tell the judge your whole story. So, all the facts and details you want the judge to consider should be stated in your declaration.</p>

<p>Your declaration may be up to 10 pages long,&nbsp;doubled spaced using 12 point font. When writing or typing your declaration, keep in mind the judge will have to read this and refer to it at your hearing. Use descriptive headings for your paragraphs. This should tell the judge what the paragraph is about. You should start with the most important issue and the most recent event. When the judge is finished reading your declaration there should be no doubt about what you want, why you want it and why the judge should do what you want.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Attaching Documents (Exhibits)</strong>

<p>Exhibits are documents that support something you are saying in your declaration. If you believe there are documents the judge should read, you may attach them to your declaration. You must properly describe the document in your declaration by stating what the document is, what exhibit number you have assigned it and why the document is important for the judge to consider, e.g. “Attached as Exhibit 1 is a true and correct copy of my paystubs for the last 3 months showing my gross monthly income is $1550.<br/>

<strong>What Orders Can You Request</strong>

<p><strong>Legal Custody</strong>: Legal custody deals with the parents’ right to make the decisions relating to the child’s health, education and welfare.&nbsp; One or both parents can have legal custody.&nbsp; If both parents are making decisions about the child it is called joint legal custody.&nbsp; When writing your declaration you need to explain why it is in the child’s best interest for one or both parents to make these decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Physical Custody</strong>: Physical custody deals with the days and times that the child will spend with each parent.&nbsp; If the child primarily lives with one parent it is called physical custody.&nbsp; If you are requesting that both parents spend a substantial period of time with the child, it is called Joint Physical Custody.&nbsp; When writing your declaration you need to explain why your proposed physical custody request is in the child’s best interest.</p>

<p><strong>Visitation</strong>: Visitation is the time&nbsp;the child spends with the parent who does not primarily live with the child.&nbsp; When writing your declaration you need to explain why your proposed visitation schedule is in the child’s best interest.&nbsp; There are several options to choose from when it comes to visitation, generally they are: (1) Reasonable Visitation (2) Specific Visitation Schedule (3) Supervised Visitation.&nbsp; <em>Reasonable visitation</em> does not define the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child.&nbsp; A reasonable visitation court order usually works when both parents are in agreement about the time share that each is to have with the child.&nbsp; A <em>specific visitation schedule</em> defines the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child.&nbsp; A specific visitation schedule may be necessary for parents who have a difficult time agreeing on the days and times that each parent will spend with the child.&nbsp; <em>Supervised Visitation</em> requires that a responsible adult be present during any visitation times with the child.&nbsp; A supervised visitation order may be necessary if there are reasonable concerns that a parent may harm the child if left alone.&nbsp; You may request a non-professional or professional supervisor.&nbsp; Click here for more&nbsp;information on Supervised Visitation.</p>

<p><strong>Prevent Child Abduction</strong>:&nbsp; If there are facts that show that the other parent may be thinking of taking the child and hiding the child from you, then you may request orders to prevent the other parent from abducting the child.&nbsp; When writing your declaration you need to explain what the other party has done or plans to do to take and hide the child from you.</p>

<p><strong>Child Support</strong>:&nbsp; Both parents are required to financially support the minor child.&nbsp; Child support is the amount of money that one parent pays to the other to equalize the financial responsibility.&nbsp; The amount of child support is arrived by inputting several numbers into a formula.&nbsp; The main factors that are taken into consideration are: (1) Dad’s gross monthly income (2) Mom’s gross monthly income and (3) Percentage of time that is spent with the child.&nbsp; When writing your declaration, you must address each of these factors.&nbsp; The judge needs to know what you are claiming each of these numbers is and also how you arrived at those numbers.&nbsp; Other facts that may be discussed in your declaration are: (1) the other parent’s ability to earn income, (2) the number of other biological children living with you (3) the amount of child care costs per month (4) the amount of rental income received (5) the amount of property taxes and mortgage interest paid per month and (6) the amount paid per month for health insurance premiums.&nbsp; You may attach any supporting documentation to your declaration as exhibits.&nbsp; Be prepared for what the amount of child support might be.&nbsp; Before you file your OSC, the Self-Help Center / Family Law Facilitator may help you calculate the amount of child support or you may go to https://www.cse.ca.gov/ChildSupport/cse/guidelineCalculator to calculate the child support amount on your own.</p>

<p><strong>Spousal Support</strong>:&nbsp; (formerly known as “ALIMONY”):&nbsp; The judge has discretion to order the payment of spousal support.&nbsp; The judge will consider several factors before deciding whether to award spousal support, the amount of spousal support and the length of time that spousal support will be received.&nbsp; Some of the factors the judge will consider are:&nbsp; (1) Spouse’s ability to pay spousal support (2) Other spouse’s need to receive spousal support and (3) Standard of living during your marriage.&nbsp; When writing your declaration, you must address each of these factors.&nbsp; The judge needs to know what you think your spouse’s income is and how you arrived at that number.&nbsp; In addition, your declaration must give details that describe your standard of living during the marriage which may include the number and kinds of vacations you took together, the kind of home you lived in, the kind of cars you owned, etc.Other factors that you may include in your declaration are the following: (1) Length of marriage (2) Age and health of each spouse (3) How much income each spouse can earn on their own (4) What the expenses of each spouse are (5) The history of the way the couple handled money during the marriage (6) Whether having a job would make it too hard to take care of the children (7) Whether one spouse helped the other get an education, training, career, or professional license (8) Whether there was domestic violence in the marriage or domestic partnership and (9) Whether one spouse's career was affected by unemployment, or by taking care of the children or home.</p>

<p><strong>Attorney's Fees and Costs</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;You may request that the other party pay for your attorney’s fees and costs.&nbsp; The judge has discretion to grant or deny this request.&nbsp; When writing your declaration, you must establish in sufficient detail that the other party has the financial ability to pay your attorney’s fees and costs.</p>

<p><strong>Property Restraint</strong>:&nbsp; You may request that the other party be prohibited from cashing out 401K’s, checking accounts, savings accounts, etc.&nbsp; When writing your declaration, you must describe why this order is necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Property Control</strong>:&nbsp; You may request an order giving you permission to use a car or live in the house.&nbsp; Your declaration must describe why this order is necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Other Relief</strong>:&nbsp; You may request any other relief not already covered.&nbsp; For example, you may request to (1) set aside default (2) change venue (3) reimbursement of half of uninsured health care expenses.&nbsp; Your declaration must describe why this order is necessary.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Costs Involved</strong>

<p><strong>Filing Fee</strong>: $60 filing fee for the regular Request for Order.&nbsp;There is an additional fee of $25 to modify child custody or visitation orders.&nbsp;There is an additional fee of $60 to request an ex parte hearing.&nbsp; The court will also charge a first appearance fee of $435 if it was not previously paid or waived. If you wish a record made of the proceedings, you must provide your own court reporter. If you do not have a court reporter present at your hearing, you will not be able to request a transcript of your hearing in the future.&nbsp;If you need assistance in obtaining a court-approved list of pro tem reporters, contact the supervising court reporter at (805) 781-1132</p>

Traffic Violation Types,"<p>The Traffic department <strong>handles infractions only</strong> - misdemeanors are handled by our Criminal department.<br/>
&nbsp;

<strong>Parking Citations</strong>

<p>Parking citations are generally processed by each issuing city or law enforcement agency, and may not go through the court at all.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions on your citation. Contact the city or agency that issued the parking citation for information.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Infractions</strong>

<p>An infraction is a violation of or failure to comply with certain provisions of the Vehicle Code, local ordinance or other law or statute.</p>

<p>Example infractions are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Speeding,</li>
	<li>Automobile equipment needing repair, and</li>
	<li>Expired vehicle registrations</li>
</ul>

<p>Punishment of an infraction is a fine only. The total fine for an infraction can be over $200. It may also include mandatory Community Work Service, such as trash pickup, in the case of littering.</p>

<p>Traffic infractions are enforced by law enforcement who issue traffic tickets (“citations”). It is important to read the information on the front and back of the citation.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Misdemeanors</strong>

<p>Examples of misdemeanors are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>reckless driving,</li>
	<li>driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs (DUI),</li>
	<li>and hit and run.</li>
</ul>

<p>These violations are <em>not</em> handled by the Traffic court. They may be misdemeanors or felonies, and they are heard in the Criminal Courts.</p>

<p>Misdemeanor offenses are typically punishable by up to a year in jail, by a fine not exceeding $1,000 (plus assessment and fees), or both. (Specific California laws may raise these limits for some offenses.)<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Mandatory Appearance?</strong>

<p>Some violations require a mandatory appearance in court; others may be handled by mail or on the phone.</p>

<strong>Mandatory appearance violations</strong>

<p>These require your appearance in court on the date/time/location indicated on your Citation/Courtesy Bail Notice. You will be required to appear in court before paying your fine.</p>

<p>If you fail to appear in court by the due date indicated on your Courtesy Bail Notice and did not request an extension, you may be subject to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>An additional Failure to Appear charge which is a misdemeanor and punishable by a fine, or jail, or both.</li>
	<li>A civil assessment of up to&nbsp;$300.00 pursuant to PC1214.1.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the Department of Motor Vehicles may revoke or suspend your driver's license, and/or withhold its issuance or renewal.</p>

<strong>Non-Mandatory Appearance Violations</strong>

<p>If the Courtesy Bail Notice does not indicate Mandatory Appearance, your options are to:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Pay the traffic ticket</strong> prior to your required appearance date. The traffic ticket will remain on your driving record.</li>
	<li><strong>Attend Traffic School.</strong> Eligibility Requirements</li>
	<li><strong>Appear in Court</strong>. If you are unable to appear at the date and time indicated on your citation or Courtesy Notice, contact the traffic office for a single 30 day extension.</li>

Contesting a Citation,"<p><strong>Your Rights</strong>

<p>As a defendant you have the following constitutional and statutory rights:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To be informed of the charges against you in open court.</li>
	<li>To be represented by a lawyer.</li>
</ul>

<p>(a) In infraction matters, you are not entitled to a court appointed lawyer, however you may hire your own lawyer.</p>

<p>(b) In misdemeanor matters, you may hire your own lawyer or if you cannot afford a lawyer, the court may appoint one for you at no initial cost. (However, the court may order reimbursement of costs according to your ability to pay.)</p>

<ul>
	<li>To a speedy and public trial within 45 days of arraignment, or a court trial in infraction cases</li>
	<li>To confront and cross-examine the witnesses against you.</li>
	<li>To put on a defense and as part of that defense to testify in your own behalf and to obtain a document (a subpoena) to compel witnesses to appear without expense to you. More information regarding subpoenas</li>
	<li>To remain silent and not to be called as a witness during your own court proceeding.</li>
	<li>To a court or jury trial in misdemeanor cases.</li>
	<li>To appeal if you are found guilty at a trial, provided you file your notice of appeal within 30 days and follow other court rules. Appeal Instructions CR-141<br/>
	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<strong>Pleading Not Guilty</strong>

<p>If you plead not guilty, you are telling the Court you want to contest the charge(s) against you. A contested trial will be scheduled within 45 days. You may waive your right to a speedy trial and have it scheduled within a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<p>While many individuals with a good record may be released on their promise to appear, the court may require bail to be posted to secure appearance at trial, particularly <strong>if you have previous failures to appear or pay.</strong></p>

<p>At your trial, the officer who issued the citation will testify as a witness. If there are other witnesses, they may also be called to testify.</p>

<p>At the trial you may question (cross-examine) the witnesses. You may testify yourself and / or call witnesses to testify.</p>

<p>After the evidence is presented the judge may rule immediately whether you are guilty or not guilty or the case may be taken under submission before deciding. If the case is taken under submission, you will be notified of the ruling by mail or you may choose to return to court.</p>

<p>If you are found not guilty, that is the end of the case. If you are found guilty, the judge will determine how much the fine will be. <strong>The fine may be more or less than the bail originally quoted in your case </strong>depending on the facts which were presented. If your driving record shows previous convictions, the fine may increase substantially and your driver's license may be suspended for up to 6 months.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Trials</strong>

<p><strong>Trial by Written Declaration</strong> – This option is for infraction violations only and does not require a personal appearance. You may request a Trial by Written Declaration which requires you to post bail in lieu of your appearance.</p>

<p>Instructions and forms for a Trial by Written Declaration may be obtained on our forms page, by mail, or in person. Submit the Trial by Written Declaration form with any facts or evidence you wish to have considered. A written statement will be requested from the citing officer(s). A judicial officer will review your case and you will be notified by mail of the decision</p>

<p><strong>Court Trial</strong> – This option requires a court appearance and is available for all violations.</p>

<p>A Court Trial requires you to post bail if you do not appear for arraignment. Posting bail pursuant to VC40519(b) constitutes a waiver of your right to a speedy trial within 45 days. Send a check or money order for the total bail or appear for an arraignment and enter your plea after which the court will set your trial date and notice you by mail. If you fail to appear at the time designated for your trial, either a trial in your absence will occur (Trial in Absentia), or a VC40508(a) misdemeanor charge may be added against you, which bears a $300.00 assessment and a driver’s license suspension until resolved.</p>

<p>For more information, see Pleading Not Guilty, above.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong> What is a Subpoena?</strong>

<p>A Subpoena is actually an order from the Court telling a person to either show up in court, or to bring something to court. When a Subpoena is directed to a person to appear in court, it is called a personal subpoena. When it is used to get a thing into court (like a photograph or sign), it is called a “Subpoena Duces Tecum” – which means, basically, Subpoena “bring with you”.</p>

<p>In CA there is a mandatory form for Criminal and Traffic Court subpoenas that is published by the Judicial Council Subpoena Form CR-125.</p>

<strong>What Sort of Things Does a Subpoena Work For?</strong>

<p>A Traffic Court Defendant in California can use a Subpoena to require any witness to appear in court. This includes police, bystanders who saw what happened, passengers, the person who maintains the machine, or the tow truck driver who impounded the car.</p>

<p>A Subpoena can also be used to get things into trial such as photos, maintenance records, radar guns, video recordings, paperwork, etc.</p>

<p>If you want to force a thing to come to court, you have to direct the subpoena to the “Custodian of Records” – or the person who is known to have possession or control over the item. Most large businesses and government agencies (including the CHP) have a person designated as the “Custodian of Records” who is responsible for responding to subpoenas.</p>

<strong>How Does a Defendant Representing Themselves Get a Subpoena Issued?</strong>

<p>In cases where a defendant represents themselves, (called “pro per”), the Defendant has the right to use a Subpoena, but they must get the court clerk to sign the completed Subpoena Form.</p>

<p>You can download the Judicial Council Subpoena Form CR-125. Then fill in as much information as possible and take it in person to the clerk’s office for issuance. Once there, tell the clerk that you need to get the subpoena issued, give them the form&nbsp;and ask for a signature and stamp.</p>

<strong>Once a Subpoena is Issued by the Court Clerk, It Must Be Personally Served on the Witness or Custodian.</strong>

<p>To be enforceable, a Subpoena must be personally handed to the person it is directed to. Defendants cannot serve the Subpoena themselves. There must be an Independent Person to Serve the Subpoena such as the Sheriff’s Department Process Service.</p>

<p>Once a Subpoena is served, the server must fill out the attached “Proof of Service” so the service can be verified in court.</p>

<p>There are time limits to serving a subpoena so that the witness or custodian has time to get ready. &nbsp;At least 10 days is required for most things or witnesses.</p></p>

Appearing in Court,"<p>
<strong>How do I set a court date?</strong>

<p>If you wish to appear before a judge or court commissioner, you must check in with the clerk in the Traffic Department at the&nbsp;location indicated on your citation, no later than the appearance date stated, to be placed on the court calendar. <em>If you are under 18 years of age, your case is&nbsp;automatically set on calendar. No check-in is required. Your appearance location and time should be noted on the bottom of your citation. </em></p>

<p>Your appearance date, place, and time are indicated on your copy of the citation, and on your courtesy bail notice. (The officer who issued your citation will not be present.)</p>

<p>If your citation has been filed with the court by the citing agency, you may appear prior to your due date that is noted on the bottom of your citation.</p>

<p>Shorts, tank tops, bare feet, and other inappropriate attire are not allowed in the courtroom.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Appearing in Court</strong>

<p>When you appear in traffic court, the first appearance is for <strong>Arraignment</strong>, which is when you enter a plea.</p>

<p>The judge will ask that you step before the bench and confirm your understanding of the charges. If you do not understand, the charges and the potential consequences in the event of conviction will be read to you. Thereafter, you are asked which plea you want to enter.</p>

<p>There are several pleas you can enter; the most common are:</p>

<strong>Guilty Plea</strong>

<p>If you plead guilty you can give the judge an explanation about what happened.</p>

<p>If the judicial officer reduces your fine, he or she can order it be paid immediately, and, considering your prior convictions and any facts in aggravation, can increase the fine over the bail amount.</p>

<strong>No Contest Plea</strong>

<p>This is the same as a guilty plea <em>except </em>if you are involved in a civil suit (arising from your actions the citation was issued for) - such as a traffic accident - a no contest plea cannot be used against you in a later civil proceeding.</p>

<p>If the judicial officer reduces your fine, he or she can order it be paid immediately, and, considering your prior convictions and any facts in aggravation, can increase the fine over the bail amount.</p>

<strong>Not Guilty Plea</strong>

<p>The judge will order your case scheduled for&nbsp;trial to determine your innocence or guilt. <strong>You will be notified by mail of your court trial date and time to appear. It is your responsibility to assure that the court does have your correct mailing address and a phone number&nbsp;where you can be contacted. </strong></p>

<p>You may not give an explanation at arraignment since the facts will be covered at your trial.</p>

<strong>Appearing in Court on a Failure to Appear</strong>

<p>If your case is in a Failure to Appear status, you may contact the court for appearance location, dates and times that you may appear on your case. If you have relevant documentation to show the Traffic Commissioner such as proof of correction, a doctor’s note, proof of incarceration, death certificate, or proof of financial situation, please bring that with you to court.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Conduct During Court Proceedings</strong>

<p>During court you are expected to sit quietly and refrain from talking, chewing gum, reading newspapers, or other behavior that would distract the court and others.</p>

<p>Shorts, tank tops, and other inappropriate attire are not permitted and you will not be allowed to appear if so dressed. Hats are not to be worn in the courtroom. No food, drinks, or weapons of any kind are allowed in the courtroom.</p>

<p>Pagers, telephones, and other audible electronic devices are to be turned off or made silent before entering the courtroom.</p>

<strong>Judicial Mediation Order</strong>

<p>Contact the Civil Department at (805)706-3600. Have your case number ready and tell the clerk you need to schedule a <strong>Judicial Mediation</strong>. Judicial Mediation can only be requested <em>in court</em>, must be <em>ordered by the judge</em>, and is only allowed for <em>unlimited cases</em>. If your case number starts with an <strong>LC</strong> you’ll need to contact a private mediator.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>


<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>

<p>If your case has recently been filed, please refer to your Case Management Order. You'll note that early mediation is strongly encouraged and that the court will typically&nbsp;provide&nbsp;an order to mediate at an early case management conference.</p>

<p>If you've had your case management conference, you may already have a <strong>Mediation Order</strong>. This order provides a deadline by which you must have completed mediation, as well as information on who must be present for the mediation session. Scheduling can take time. Contact a mediator (or the civil department if you have been ordered to Judicial Mediation) to schedule your mediation session well ahead of time or you may miss your deadline.&nbsp;Reviewing our court's Local Rules may also be helpful.</p>


<p>Benefits to Mediation</p></p>",https://www.slo.courts.ca.gov/dv/civil.htm,
Alternative Dispute Resolution,"<p>ADR is an acronym for “Alternative Dispute Resolution”. ADR programs provide alternative ways to resolve your dispute. Generally, these include using a neutral third party to help you find a resolution. While the court may be considered the original “neutral third party”, most people find litigation (court procedures) to be time consuming, stressful, and expensive. ADR programs are here to offer you an option that can bring closure more efficiently and in some ways, more effectively.

<p>San Luis Obispo County Superior Court ADR programs include Mediation and Arbitration. View&nbsp;a list of the mediators that can be found in the Mediation Binders located in all civil courtrooms.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Mediation</strong>

<p>Mediation is fair, voluntary, confidential, and flexible. Choosing mediation allows you to try and resolve the situation based on what’s most important to you.The mediator facilitates a productive process to help break down the barriers in communication that often go up due to conflict, and to explore options allowing parties to arrive at a mutual, acceptable resolution.The mediator does not decide the dispute; the parties retain power over the outcome.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Arbitration</strong>

<p>Arbitration is normally an informal process in which a neutral person (the arbitrator) decides the dispute after hearing the evidence and arguments of the parties.The parties can agree to binding or non-binding arbitration.Binding arbitration is designed to give each side a resolution of their dispute when they cannot agree between themselves or with a mediator. If the arbitration is non-binding, any party can reject the arbitrator’s decision and request a trial. Generally arbitration must be ordered by the court. In San Luis Obispo Superior Court if there is an order for non-binding arbitration, arrangements are made through Jury Services.</p>

<strong>What are the potential advantages of ADR?</strong>

<ul>
	<li>ADR can <strong>save time and money</strong>. ADR, especially when used early in a dispute, can save a lot of time and money. Even when ADR does not result in an immediate resolution, it can produce savings by clarifying and narrowing the scope of the dispute.</li>
	<li>ADR provides <strong>increased flexibility and control</strong>. ADR typically gives you greater flexibility and control in the dispute resolution process - in the procedures followed, the interests considered and the remedies adopted - than you would have in a court trial. In mediation, for example, you can work out a resolution that may not be available in court.</li>
	<li>ADR is generally <strong>confidential</strong>. Confidentiality encourages openness and candor, and is considered an important factor in the effectiveness of ADR.</li>
	<li>ADR can <strong>improve communication and preserve relationships</strong>. Some ADR processes are designed to reduce the hostility created by the dispute and to help each side communicate with the other. This is particularly true of mediation. The aim of mediation is to create a cooperative atmosphere in which both sides can find ""win-win"" solutions that will preserve or improve, rather than further damage, the relationship.</li>
	<li>ADR can give you <strong>a chance to tell your side of the story</strong>. Some ADR processes will permit you to tell your side of the story in a way that cannot be done in court. This opportunity for both sides to be heard can make the difference between a satisfying or frustrating dispute resolution process.</li>
	<li>ADR can <strong>reduce stress and increase satisfaction</strong>. Litigation can be highly stressful. Lack of control over the process and outcome, prolonged uncertainty and mounting costs all contribute to such stress. The benefits of many ADR processes - reduced expense, confidentiality, a quicker process, an out-of-court setting and greater control for those involved, for example - often make them less stressful.</li>

            <p>A pension can be more valuable than any other asset acquired during the marriage or domestic partnership, including a house. It may be worth more than all of the other assets put together.&nbsp; There are very specific and technical rules that apply to pensions and you should get legal advice from a lawyer in order to protect your interest in the pension.&nbsp; In some cases, a pension plan must be “joined” as a party in your divorce case before a judge will issue an order about how the pension will be divided. Read the Retirement Plan Joinder - Information Sheet<em> </em>(FL-318-INFO) for more information about whether the pension plan must be joined in your divorce case.&nbsp; The court order that details how a pension will be divided is called a qualified domestic relations order, or QDRO. The QDRO must be approved by both the benefits provider and the judge to assure that the spouse/partner that is not the employee of the company or organization will receive those future benefits. A QDRO is an extremely complicated legal document and if you make a mistake, there can be harmful results.</p>

            <p>California law requires that you and your spouse give each other written information about all the income, expenses, assets and debts that you know to exist.&nbsp; This act of revealing and making something known to the other person is called ""disclosure.""&nbsp; Disclosure is required at the beginning of the case (Preliminary) and end of the case (Final).&nbsp; Disclosure is intended to make sure that you and your spouse are aware of everything each of you own and owe.&nbsp; With this information you can divide your&nbsp;assets and debts equally, and can make reasonable decisions about support. If you leave anything out, either by mistake or on purpose, your property division may not be accepted by the court and your case may be reopened or changed.</p>

            <p>Legal custody deals with the parents’ right to make the decisions relating to the child’s health, education and welfare.&nbsp;One or both parents can have legal custody.&nbsp;If both parents are making decisions about the child it is called joint legal custody.</p>

            <p>Physical custody deals with the days and times that the child will spend with each parent.&nbsp;If the child primarily lives with one parent it is called physical custody.&nbsp;If you are requesting that both parents spend a substantial period of time with the child, it is called joint physical custody.</p>

            <p>Visitation is the time that the child spends with the parent who does not primarily live with.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several options to choose from when it comes to visitation, generally they are: (1) Reasonable Visitation (2) Specific Visitation Schedule and (3) Supervised Visitation.&nbsp; Reasonable visitation does not define the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child.&nbsp;A reasonable visitation court order usually works when both parents are in agreement about the time share that each is to have with the child.&nbsp;A specific visitation schedule defines the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child.&nbsp;A specific visitation schedule may be necessary for parents who have a difficult time agreeing on the days and times that each parent will spend with the child.&nbsp;Supervised Visitation requires that a responsible adult be present during any visitation times with the child.&nbsp;A supervised visitation order may be necessary if there are reasonable concerns that a parent may harm the child if left alone.&nbsp; You may request a non-professional or professional supervisor.&nbsp; Click here for more&nbsp;information on Supervised Visitation.</p>

Finish a Divorce Case: Default Hearing Checklist,"<p><strong>1. Status of Marriage</strong>

<p>Standard: Irreconcilable differences have arisen.&nbsp; If you were married, then the judge will want to know if “irreconcilable differences have arisen leading to the irremediable breakdown of the marriage.” This means that there has been a breakdown of the marriage and that no amount of counseling will reunite the two of you.&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>2. Child Custody and Visitation</strong>

<p>Standard:&nbsp; Best Interest of Child.&nbsp; If there are minor children of the marriage, then you will want to explain to the judge what you want and why.&nbsp; If you are requesting no or supervised visitation don’t forget to tell the judge why you believe your proposal is in the best interests of the child or children.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>3. Child Support / Health insurance / Child Care</strong>

<p>Main Factors to Determine Child Support:&nbsp; Dad’s Income, Mom’s Income, Percentage of Time each Parent.</p>

<p>If you are going to request a specific amount of child support at your default hearing, you may have the Self-Help Center / Family Law Facilitator calculate the possible guideline child support amount or you may want to calculate it on your own at www.childsup.ca.gov.&nbsp; In order to calculate child support you should bring a copy of your FL-150 Income and Expense Declaration.&nbsp; Also, you will have to make an estimate for the judge as to the other parent’s gross income before taxes.&nbsp; If you tell the judge, “I don’t know what s/he makes,” then the judge will have a difficult time making an order.&nbsp; Remember, you know more about what the other parent earns or is able to earn than the judge does.&nbsp; For this reason, you can describe the other parent’s occupation, experience, etc., and let the judge know what you believe the other parent is capable of earning.&nbsp; The judge can then use this figure in setting the other parent’s earnings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At your hearing, you may also request an order that the other parent carry the minor children on health insurance available through the other parent’s employment even if they don’t have insurance now.&nbsp; Note that the judge may make the same order for you that each of you carry the children on insurance that is available at no or reasonable cost through your employment.&nbsp; You may also request that each parent pay one-half of any reasonable health care expenses that are not covered by the insurance.</p>

<p>If you incur child care expenses while you are at work or school, you may request that the other parent pay for one-half of any child care expenses incurred while you are at work or school.</p>

<p>If there is a case with the Department of Child Support Services, you will want to let the judge know this. Bring a copy of the child support order with you to your hearing. If the case is in another county, you will want to tell the judge the name of the other county where the DCSS case is located.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>4. Spousal Support</strong>

<p>Main Factors:&nbsp; Ability to Pay; Need for Support; Standard of Living During Marriage; Length of Marriage; Age and health of each spouse; How much income each can earn on their own; What the expenses of each spouse are; Whether there are minor children at home; The history of the way the couple handled money during the marriage; What each person needs; What each person pays or can pay (including earnings and earning capacity); Whether having a job would make it too hard to take care of the minor children; Debts and property; Whether one spouse or domestic partner helped the other get an education, training, career, or professional license; Whether there was domestic violence in the marriage or domestic partnership; Whether one spouse's, or domestic partner's, career was affected by unemployment, or by taking care of the children or home, and; The tax impact of spousal support.</p>

<p>If you want to request a specific amount of spousal support, you will need to tell the judge all the facts in your case that are related to the factors listed above.</p>

<p>If you do not ever want spousal support (now or in the future), then let the judge know you are “waiving” spousal support.&nbsp; If you waive spousal support, you will never be able to ask for spousal support in the future, even if you need it.&nbsp; If you have a marriage of 10 years or more the court will want you to explain why this is a reasonable request.</p>

<p>If you do not ever want to pay spousal support to the other party, then let the judge know that you want to “terminate jurisdiction” over the issue of spousal support.&nbsp; If you have a marriage of 10 years or more the court will want you to explain why this is a reasonable request.</p>

<p>If you want the court to make spousal support orders in the future, then let the judge know that you want to “reserve jurisdiction” over the issue of spousal support.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>5. Assets and Debts</strong>

<p>Standard: Equal Division of Community Property and Debt.&nbsp; Remember that community property is defined as any asset or debt that was purchased or incurred after date of marriage and before date of separation.&nbsp; There are some exceptions to this rule, such as gifts or inheritance.&nbsp; Generally, in a default hearing the court wants to be able to divide that community property assets and debts equally between the parties.</p>

<p>If there are assets or debts to be divided by the judge, you should review the FL-160 Property Declaration(s) that you previously completed.&nbsp; If you are requesting that the community property assets and debts be divided unequally, you will need to tell the judge why your unequal proposal for division is a fair and equitable division.</p>

<p>If you are requesting that the court divide a pension or retirement plan then you may need to seek legal advice from an attorney before you get divorced. In most cases, the pension plan will not be able to disburse any money until a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) is signed by the judge.&nbsp; In addition, if the employee spouse dies before a QDRO is signed then the pension will not pay out any money to the spouse.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<strong>6. Restoring of your Former Name</strong>

<p>If you want the judge to order that your name be restored to your former name, be sure to request this at the time of your hearing.</p></p>",https://www.slo.courts.ca.gov/sh/selfhelp-divorce-defaulthearing.htm,https://www.slo.courts.ca.gov/sh/selfhelp-glossary.htm
