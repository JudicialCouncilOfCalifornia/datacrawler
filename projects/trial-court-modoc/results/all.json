Actually, jury service is one of the most direct ways of participation the average citizen can have in the working of government. Some have even changed careers after serving as a jury member.</p>\n\n<p>Without you, the jury system cannot work the way the authors of the Constitution envisioned. Yet jury service means rearranging schedules, canceling appointments, and often times missing work. But if you were on trial, wouldn't you want someone like you to make the sacrifices necessary to be a part of your jury? Your public service as a juror in a very real way ensures the right to trial by jury for all Americans.</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div><!-- Start Accordion Module (+ and - icons) -->\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n        <h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Common Questions and Answers</h3>\n        <div class=\"accordion-wrapper\">\n            \n            <div class=\"controls\">\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"expandall\">expand all</a> <a href=\"#\" class=\"collapseall\">collapse all</a> \n            </div>\n            <br>\n            <div id=\"bs-accordion\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\" class=\"panel-group\" role=\"tablist\">\n                <div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        <!-- Start Accordion Item -->\r\n\r\n<div role=\"tab\" class=\"panel-heading\" id=\"panelacc4662\">\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"panel-title\">\r\n        <a role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-controls=\"acc4662\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" class=\"collapsed\" href=\"#acc4662\">\r\n            What are the qualifications to serve as a juror?\r\n        </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div role=\"tabpanel\" id=\"acc4662\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"panelacc4662\">\r\n    <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>You do not need any special skills or legal knowledge to be a juror.

One way of doing this is the \"one-day or one trial\" system. It works like this: you are summoned and appear at the courthouse at the designated time. If you are not selected for a jury that day, you are excused and you have satisfied your obligation for at least a year. Or, if you are selected for a jury, service in that trial satisfies you obligation for at least a year. The idea is to minimize the inconvenience of jury service, but the system works only if citizens like you honor their duty and the law and respond to the court's summons.</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Accordon Item --><!-- Start Accordion Item -->\r\n\r\n<div role=\"tab\" class=\"panel-heading\" id=\"panelacc4664\">\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"panel-title\">\r\n        <a role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-controls=\"acc4664\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" class=\"collapsed\" href=\"#acc4664\">\r\n            How are jurors selected?\r\n        </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div role=\"tabpanel\" id=\"acc4664\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"panelacc4664\">\r\n    <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            <p>Most courts use driver license lists and voter lists to issue summonses.

Although state law does not require employers to continue paying the salaries of employees who are absent because of jury service, many employers do.</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Accordon Item -->\n                    \n                    <div class=\"clear25\"></div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<!-- End Accordion Module (+ and - icons) -->\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>"], "_template": "8bf1-45fa-a771"},

After all, isn't it our responsibility to represent the people and serve the community in the best possible ways. Below is a list of our community outreach programs and an explanation for each.\n\n</p><h3>Drug Treatment Court</h3>\n\n<p>Defendants with alcohol or other drug related offenses who plead or are deemed guilty may choose to enter the Drug Treatment Court. A collaborative team approach to treatment and supervision is designed to help individual achieve and maintain a clean and sober, productive life. The program is a minimum of 18 months duration, and requires court appearances every two weeks, intensive treatment, frequent testing, supervision and case management services. A treatment team, consisting of the Judge, substance abuse counselors, the District Attorney, Probation and a local attorney, meet prior to each Drug Court session to review progress of participants, revise treatment plans as needed and to recommend appropriate rewards and sanctions to be delivered by the judge in open court. When appropriate, individualized treatment plans address physical health, employment, mental health and family issues that may have an impact on the individual's progress in recovery. Successful completion of Drug Court may result in removal of the offense from the record of the Drug Treatment Court graduate.</p>\n\n<h3>Peer Court</h3>\n\n<p>The Modoc Juvenile Peer Court was established in 1998 as an informal means of handling certain juvenile cases that may be appropriate for formal Court proceedings. If it appears to the Probation Officer that the case would be appropriate for Peer Court (it's not a serious felony and extensive victim restitution is not being requested), the juvenile offender and his/her parent(s) are offered the opportunity to have the youth's case handled through Peer Court. The minor and parent sign a waiver of confidentiality and the minor admits the allegations for the purpose of having the matter heard in Peer Court (because the Peer Court does not determine guilt or innocence, only disposition).</p>\n\n<p>Peer Court is a good opportunity for a juvenile offender to have his/her case handled without it becoming part of a permanent delinquency record. It is also a positive learning experience for local high school students who act as prosecutors, defense attorneys and jurors.</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>"], "_template": "8bf1-45fa-a771"},

In Small Claims court, disputes are settled in a fair, quick and inexpensive manner. You may ask a lawyer for advice before you go to court; however, you may not have a lawyer represent you in court, but you may have an attorney to represent you in the appeal. The place to file a Small Claims case is at\u00a0205 S. East Street,\u00a0Alturas,\u00a0CA. The court clerks can answer many kinds of questions and provide the forms you need; however, they are prohibited by law from giving legal advice. Further information and publications are available at the Department of Consumer Affairs and the\u00a0California\u00a0Courts\u00a0Self-Help\u00a0Center\u00a0located at www.courts.ca.gov.</p>\n\n<p>The Small Claims court does not report to any credit reporting agency; however, these agencies come to the court often and place the judgment on the losing party's credit record even after the judgment is paid.</p>\n\n<p>If you need additional assistance or have questions filing your claim, contact our Small Claims Advisor, Wendy Dier, at (530) 233-2008.</p>\n\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n\n<h3>Can a Plantiff File an Appeal?</h3>\n\n<p>If you choose Small Claims court to resolve a dispute and you are the plaintiff, you give up the right to have another court review the Small Claims judge's decision. In other words, the plaintiff has no right of appeal. Therefore, if you lose, that is probably the end of the case. However, the person or entity you sue (defendant) may appeal the judge's ruling. When such an appeal is filed, the entire case will be heard again.</p>\n\n<p>If you are the plaintiff and a Claim of Defendant is filed (the defendant sues you on the same case) and you have a judgment against you, you may file an appeal on that decision.</p>\n\n<h3>What if I Have an Out of the County Claim?</h3>\n\n<p>If you are filing a Small Claims Appeal out of the county, you may obtain the forms from the\u00a0California\u00a0Courts\u00a0SelfHelp\u00a0Center\u00a0- Forms. A check off list and forms are also available at\u00a0California\u00a0Courts\u00a0SelfHelp\u00a0Center\u00a0- Small Claims Forms, including the fee waiver application and order Monetary Limit.</p>\n\n<p>The Small Claims court has a monetary limit, called a jurisdictional limit, on the amount of money damages that can be claimed. The most \"a natural person\" can ask for is $10,000; however, you are limited to filing no more than two claims anywhere in the State of\u00a0California\u00a0for over $2,500 in one calendar year. You may file an unlimited amount of claims for $2,500 or less. Corporations and other entities (such as government entities) cannot ask for more than $5,000. Service The party who has filed the case must cause the legal documents to be served upon the other party.</p>\n\n<p>If this service is not done correctly, the court will require the plaintiff to re-serve the papers correctly before the case can be heard in front of a judge.</p>\n\n<p>The following instructions will assist you in proceeding with your claim; failure to comply with these instructions may result in a delay or in your claim being dismissed.</p>\n\n<h4>Personal Service</h4>\n\n<p>This must be completed\u00b7\u00a0at least 15-days prior to the court date if the defendant is in Modoc County or at least 20-days prior if the defendant is outside of Modoc County.</p>\n\n<h4>Substituted Service</h4>\n\n<p>Sometimes it is not possible to locate the actual party named on the legal document. In this case, it is legal and proper to leave the claim with another adult at the defendant's home, or with someone who is in charge at the defendant's usual place of business. These documents must be in an envelope bearing the name of the defendant, and the server must state that the papers are for a legal case. In this situation, the documents must be served at least 25-days prior to the court date if the defendant is in\u00a0Modoc\u00a0County\u00a0or at least 30-days prior to the court date if the defendant is outside\u00a0Modoc\u00a0County. At this point, the person who served the documents must also mail the second copy of the claim to the defendant at the exact same address where the first copy was left. This is to be done with first class mail, postage pre-paid. No other form of mail is permitted.\u00a0\u00a0Marshal or Sheriff in the county where the defendant lives or does\u00b7\u00a0business.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose this method, you must then contact the Sheriff\u2019s Department for further instructions. It is your responsibility to insure that the completed proof of service is returned to the court prior to the scheduled court date. Private process server (a listing of process servers may be found\u00b7\u00a0in the yellow pages under \u201cprocess serving.)\u201d If you choose this method, you must make arrangements with the process service of your choice. It is your responsibility to insure that the completed proof of service is returned to the court prior to the scheduled court date. By anyone at least 18 years of age who is not a party to the\u00b7\u00a0action. They must fill out a proof of service form and it is your responsibility to insure that the completed proof of service is returned to the court prior to the scheduled court date. You may pay the court to do service by certified mail. You may not send the certified mail yourself. Please refer to the fee schedule.</p>\n\n<h3>What to Expect in Court</h3>\n\n<p>A lawyer is not allowed to represent you in court. However, you may talk to a lawyer before or after court.</p>\n\n<p>If you are the suing party, and you do not meet the exceptions outlined in Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7116.540, you must go to court. You cannot send a representative to take your place in court. Please consult this code section if you are in doubt.</p>\n\n<p>When a claim is filed, the clerk will schedule the hearing date approximately 45 days out to allow sufficient time for service.</p>\n\n<p>At the hearing, the judge will listen to both sides. You may bring witnesses, photos, bills, receipts, contracts, or any other proof you have. The judge may make the decision at the time of the hearing or take the matter under submission and mail the decision to you. The party filing the claim is the plaintiff and the person being sued is the defendant. If you have been named as a defendant in a Small Claims action and have received an order to appear at a Small Claims hearing, this means that you are being sued.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not know why you are being sued, contact the plaintiff immediately for an explanation. Never ignore an order to appear in court even if you think the case is wrong, unfair, or has no basis.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not appear in court at the proper time and date, the court may still hear and decide the case without you and you may lose the suit by default.</p>\n\n<p>If you believe the plaintiff has caused you injury or owes you money for any reason, you can file a claim against the plaintiff in the same Small Claims court action.</p>\n\n<p>If your case is related to the subject of the plaintiff's case, it may be helpful and convenient to resolve it at the same hearing by filing a Defendant's Claim and Order to Plaintiff. If judgment has been entered against you and the appeal time has lapsed, your money or property and maybe a portion of your earnings can then be taken legally by the judgment creditor to pay the judgment against you. A Small Claims judgment is public record.</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>"], "_template": "8bf1-45fa-a771"},

In all criminal cases, the defendant (person accused of a crime) is presumed to be innocent. That means he or she may not be convicted of a crime unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n\n<h3>What is an Infraction?</h3>\n\n<p>An infraction is an offense punishable by a fine only, and which the law declares not to be a misdemeanor or felony. A person charged with an infraction is not entitled to a trial by jury, and is not entitled to be represented by court-appointed counsel.</p>\n\n<h3>What is a Felony?</h3>\n\n<p>A felony is a crime punishable with death or by imprisonment in state prison. A defendant charged with a felony has a right to trial by jury or by Court, and has a right to be represented by an attorney at all proceedings.</p>\n\n<h3>What is a Misdemeanor?</h3>\n\n<p>A misdemeanor is a crime punishable by imprisonment in the county jail, a fine or both. If you are charged with a misdemeanor, you have a right to a trial by jury or by Court and to be represented by an attorney at all proceedings.</p>\n\n<h3>What is Bail?</h3>\n\n<p>Bail allows a defendant to be released from custody upon the posting of a bond, case deposit, or other security deemed necessary to guarantee the defendant\u2019s appearance in court.</p>\n\n<h3>What is an Arraignment?</h3>\n\n<p>The arraignment consists of reading the complaint or citation to the defendant and asking him/her whether he/she pleads guilty or not guilty.</p>\n\n<h3>What is a Preliminary Hearing?</h3>\n\n<p>A preliminary hearing is a hearing to determine if there is enough evidence to proceed with the case.</p>\n\n<h3>What is a Pretrial Conference?</h3>\n\n<p>The purpose of the pretrial conference is to discuss the possibility of disposing of the case prior to trial or to discuss measures to facilitate the expeditious handling of the trial.</p>\n\n<h3>Am I entitled to a Jury Trial?</h3>\n\n<p>A person charged with a misdemeanor or felony is entitled to a jury trial. A trial by court (judge only) is held for those that are charged with infractions or those defendants who waive their right to a jury trial.</p>\n\n<h3>Do I have to appear in Court?</h3>\n\n<p>Court appearances are mandatory on criminal misdemeanor and felony cases and can be on some infractions. You must appear at the Court on the date and time as directed on your release paper or arraignment letter. Failure to appear may result in a warrant for your arrest. On your court date, please report to the Clerk\u2019s Office. Be prepared to provide identification and information on the arrest or alleged offense, including jail release paperwork, notice to appear, bail or bond receipts, or arraignment letter.</p>\n\n<h3>How do I pay my fine?</h3>\n\n<p>All fines are due by the date the judge specifies in court. Your paperwork will reflect the amount owed and the due date. If you do not pay or set up a payment plan by the due date, your case will be referred to the Collections Department and a warrant can be issued for your arrest. Payments may be sent by mail, in person, or paid through a work program referral by the Court. If you are requesting a work program, you must make arrangements to appear in Court. We currently accept cash, personal checks, money orders, and credit/debit cards. Please do not mail cash. The Court only accepts U.S. Funds. Please make checks payable to Modoc Superior Court and include you case number on the check.</p>\n\n<h3>What happens if I fail to appear or pay a fine?</h3>\n\n<p>If you fail to appear in court or pay a fine as promised/ordered, the Court will order and issue a warrant for your arrest. Further, you may be punished by jail and/or a fine, regardless of the disposition of the original charge. In an effort to facilitate the effective collection of fines, fees, and assessments ordered or authorized by the court, your case may be referred to a collection agency. Section 1214.1(a) of the Penal Code states, \u201cIn addition to any other penalty in infraction, misdemeanor, or felony cases, the court may impose a civil assessment of up to three hundred dollars ($300).\u201d</p>\n\n<h3>What help is provided to the victim(s) of a crime?</h3>\n\n<p>For information about assistance available to victims and victim restitution, please call the Modoc County Victim Witness Advocate at (530) 233-3311.</p>\n\n<h3>How do I get court-appointed counsel?</h3>\n\n<p>You may request Court-Appointed Counsel from the judge at your first appearance in court. The judge will require that you fill out a financial declaration and determine if you qualify. At the end of your case, a hearing will be held to see if you must reimburse the court for some or all of the cost of the Court-Appointed Counsel fees.</p>\n\n<h3>My friend or family member is in custody, can i speak to them while they are in court?</h3>\n\n<p>No, you may be charged with a misdemeanor if you attempt to speak or motion to anyone in custody.</p>\n\n<h3>How do I find out about someone who is in custody?</h3>\n\n<p>Contact the Modoc County Sheriff\u2019s Department at (530) 233-4416, or stop in at 102 S. Court Street, Alturas, CA.</p>\n\n<h3>Can I get copies of criminal records?</h3>\n\n<p>The court clerks maintain an index of filings and a record of dispositions.

Civil matters include small claims, civil matters, conservatorships, probate, family law, adoption, and juvenile compromises.</p>\n\n<p>A civil case can be filed by a party to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Enforce a contract or agreement</li>\n\t<li>Collect damages to their person or property</li>\n\t<li>Recover money or property</li>\n\t<li>Protect a civil right</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What is the difference between Limited and Unlimited Civil Cases?</h3>\n\n<p>Generally, civil lawsuits are divided into three categories, which are based on the amount of money involved in the lawsuit. Examples of cases that are generally excluded from this are unlawful detainer, juvenile, civil harassment, probate, and family matters. When the dollar amount is under $10,000, it is usually referred to as a Small Claims case. When the dollar amount is less than or equal to $25,000, it is referred to as a limited jurisdiction civil case. When the dollar amount exceeds $25,000, it is referred to as an unlimited jurisdiction civil case. Where can I get help with my civil case?

Some temporary disabilities may also qualify.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<h3>How do I get an accommodation? May I get help filling out <a href=\"https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/mc410.pdf\">Form MC-410</a>?</h3>\n\n\t<p>You may request an accommodation by filling out <a href=\"https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/mc410.pdf\">Form MC-410</a>, available from any clerk\u2019s office or from the courtrooms. You may also make a request for an accommodation in writing or orally to the Court or other designated personnel.</p>\n\n\t<p>You may make a request at any time, although you should give the Court at least five (5) working days. If you are unable to fill out the form and you need assistance, you may request a clerk or other Court personnel to assist you in writing down the information. All the information you supply is confidential. You may wish to attach documents such as a doctor\u2019s letter to the form.</p>\n\n\t<p>After the form is completed, you must sign it under penalty of perjury, which means that everything you state in the form is true under oath, to the best of your knowledge.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<h3>What may Court personnel ask about my disability? Do I have to let everyone know about my medical problems/conditions?</h3>\n\n\t<p>Under most circumstances, the Court or its employees will not need additional medical or other personal information.</p>\n\n\t<p><a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=one&amp;linkid=rule1_100\">Rule 1.100</a> allows the Court to request further information. This means that only those persons in the Court who need to know about your disability in order to make a decision or provide you with an accommodation will learn the details of your request and the personal information that you provide.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<h3>Do I have a responsibility to inform the Court that I need an accommodation?</h3>\n\n\t<p>Yes, it is your responsibility to contact the Court to request accommodations that would best suit your situation. The Court has an obligation to inform the public of the availability of accommodations. However, if no accommodation is requested, the Court is not required to provide one.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<h3>What if the Court suggests a different accommodation?</h3>\n\n\t<p>The Court may offer a different or alternative accommodation. For example, if a juror is blind and requests written material introduced at trial to be transcribed in Braille, the Court may consider alternatives, such as providing a reader or tape-recorded transcripts of the written material. The Court itself may offer an accommodation. The Court is not required to provide the best accommodation, but must provide an effective one.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<h3>Do I have to accept alternative accommodations?</h3>\n\n\t<p>You do not have to accept the alternative accommodation. The Court is required to find an accommodation that will effectively allow you full participation in the Court proceedings. The accommodation may not be your first or preferred choice; however, if you make a request for another type of accommodation, the Court must consider your request.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<h3>May the Court deny my request?</h3>\n\n\t<p>Yes, however, you may file an appeal if the Court denies your request for a preferred accommodation or the Court provides an accommodation that you believe to be inadequate. To be appropriate, the Court\u2019s denial must be in writing and state specific grounds within <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=one&amp;linkid=rule1_100\">Rule 1.100</a> for the denial.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div> \n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>"], "_template": "8bf1-45fa-a771"},

It is a land mark that can be seen from any highway or trail coming into Alturas. The beauty and grandeur of this impressive building is worthy as a monument for future generations. The planners of construction in 1914 had wonderful foresight in building such a superior quality structure. The timeless architecture and the striking copper painted dome provides a government seat that any county would be proud of.</p>\n\n<h2>A Brief History of Modoc Courthouses</h2>\n\n<p class=\"auto-style24\">There have been a total of three county courthouses since the county was created from a section of Siskiyou County on February 17, 1874. The first county courthouse was actually a \"community building\" that served the public in a variety of ways. Not only court sessions were held in this building but public meetings, church services, and dances as well. It was a long building with a low ceiling that got hot in the summer and cold in the winter.</p>\n\n<p>The first real county courthouse was constructed in 1883-1884 and stood at the site where the Veteran's Memorial Building is located today (Main and Water Streets). The cost of this first courthouse was a total of $3,244 and T.B. Reese was the superintendent of construction. The building served as the courthouse for nearly 40 years before the present courthouse was built. The building was torn down in its later years for salvage lumber.</p>\n\n<p>Then, in 1914, the majestic building that still stands today was designed by Frederick J. DeLonchamps. The building costs totaled nearly $90,000 with W.N. Concannon being awarded the general building contract. The DeLonchamps' plan alone cost a whopping $5,040. DeLonchamps also designed courthouses in Yolo, and Riverside counties in California and Washoe County in Nevada. However, the Modoc County Courthouse is the only building designed by Delonchamps that is still being used.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row mb-4\">\n<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-3\"><img src=\"/images/modoc/courthouse_old_thumb.jpg\" height=\"135\" width=\"167\" alt=\"Courthouse blueprint drawing\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-9\">A blueprint sketch made by Frederick J.

It is exemplified by Greek and Roman influence, symmetrical arrangement, building of monumental proportions, and finished with a polished \"stone\" surface. It is built of reinforced concrete, stuccoed and scored to imitate stone masonry. The style is similar to the Beaux Art style, but lacks the variety of stonework, and a large exuberance of detail such as curly cues, gingerbread, and fancy windows. The interior is finely decorated with marble and brass. The building's many windows provide adequate light that gives the interior a warm and welcoming feeling.
