Clarification of these issues is currently being sought from the California Attorney General. In 1995, the tribe assumed, by federal order, jurisdication over juvenile dependency caseload. This has reduced the workload of the court in this area.\u00a0 The county court currently maintains jurisdication over juvenile deliquency cases and this workload is expected to increase.</span></p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div><div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n                        <h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Community Outreach</h3>\r\n                            \r\n         \r\n        <p>Community outreach in a small county is a part of everyday activity.\u00a0\u00a0 Judges campaign door to door for election and have the opportunity to talk to every citizen directly about the court and their perceptions of the services rendered. Formal opportunites, facilities, or activities that exist for community outreach in larger communties are not present in Alpine County.\u00a0 There is no high school or college in Alpine County.\u00a0 There are no service clubs, no radio or television broadcasters, and only a limited monthly newspaper.\u00a0 Only a few opportunites exist, or can be created, for the purpose of reaching the approximately 1200 residents of the county.\u00a0 This plan contemplates the limited opportunites for community outreach in Alpine County, and incorporates the admonition from the members of the Alpine County community that public funds not be spent on public relations activities.</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>"], "url": "https://www.alpine.courts.ca.gov/"},

This cherished right is guaranteed by both the United States and California constitution. You may be called to serve if you are 18 years of age or older, a United States citizen, and a resident of the county where summoned. Jurors are selected at random from lists of registered voters and persons who have valid California drivers' licenses or identification card issued by the department of motor vehicles (DMV).</p>\n\n<p>Alpine County Superior Court schedules jury trials for\u00a0two weeks each calendar quarter (unless circumstances dictate an extraordinary trial setting).\u00a0 Each jury period begins on that Monday, and should the second week be needed, the trial will begin again on Tuesday of that second week.</p>\n\n<h3>Length of Service</h3>\n\n<p>Jurors may have to participate in more than one trial during their week of service and more than one trial week per year. This is due to the severely limited jury pool in Alpine County.\u00a0 The Alpine County Superior Court attempts to accommodate juror scheduling preferences and also allow those in snow bound communities (Bear Valley) to participate in the spring/summer when transportation is less difficult.</p>\n\n<h3>Qualification Requirements</h3>\n\n<p>A person is competent to act as a juror if he or she is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>A citizen of the United States of the age of 18 years who meets the residence requirements of electors of this state;</li>\n\t<li>In possession of his or her natural faculties and of ordinary intelligence, provided that no person shall be deemed incompetent solely because of the loss of sight or hearing in any degree or other disability which impedes the ability to communicate or interferes with the person's mobility; and</li>\n\t<li>Possessed of sufficient knowledge of the English language.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A person is not competent to act as a trial juror if any of the following apply:</p>\n\n<ol type=\"a\">\n\t<li>The person does not possess the qualifications listed.</li>\n\t<li>The persons has been convicted of malfeasance in office or any felony or other high crime;</li>\n\t<li>The person is serving as a grand juror in any court of this State.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Excuse</h3>\n\n<p>Section 204(b), Code of Civil Procedure.<br>\nThe court shall excuse a person from jury service upon finding that the jury service would entail undue hardship on the person or the public served by the person.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Submit request in writing.</li>\n\t<li>Provide specific facts as to the nature and length of the hardship.</li>\n\t<li>If hardship is not expected to end during the next 12 months, state the reason(s), detailing why alternative arrangements cannot be made.
