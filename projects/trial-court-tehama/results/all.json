Investigators must visit conservatees regularly, review health and medical records, examine financial accountings prepared by conservators, and prepare reports for the Court on their findings.</p>\n\n<h4>Guardianships</h4>\n\n<p>Court investigators review and report on the qualifications of people who are seeking court appointment as guardians for children. These investigations include site visits and interviews with proposed guardians and others to determine the potential impact of the physical, emotional and social environment on the children.<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Conservatorships</h3>\n\n<p>A conservatorship is a court proceeding to appoint a qualified person to manage the personal care and/or the financial affairs of an individual who is either physically or mentally unable to handle his or her own affairs.\u00a0 A person or organization the Court appoints to do this is known as the \"conservator.\" A conservator can be a family member, friend or professional person. The person who is unable to care for him or herself is called the \"conservatee.\"</p>\n\n<p>A conservatorship of the person ends when the conservatee dies or the conservatee regains the ability to handle his or her own personal affairs. A conservatorship of the estate ends when the Court terminates the conservatorship of the estate, typically when the conservatorship estate funds are depleted or when the conservatee dies or regains the ability to handle his or her own financial affairs.</p>\n\n<p>General or Limited Conservatorships</p>\n\n<p>A <strong>Limited Probate Conservatorship</strong> applies when the conservatee is developmentally disabled. In this type of conservatorship, the powers of the conservator are limited so that the disabled person may live as independently as possible.</p>\n\n<p>A <strong>General Probate Conservatorship</strong> is for all other adults who are unable to provide for their personal needs due to physical injury, advanced age, dementia, or other conditions rendering them incapable of caring for themselves or making them subject to undue influence.</p>\n\n<p>Once a Petition for Conservatorship has been filed, the Court will set the matter for hearing. Court investigators are assigned to interview all persons who are the subject of a petition for conservatorship before the first hearing is held. The court investigator may interview numerous family members, neighbors and others to provide as much information as possible to the Court to assist in making a determination as to whether to grant the conservatorship. When interviewing the proposed conservatee, the purpose of the interview is to determine whether the person understands the proceedings or has any objections to them.</p>\n\n<p>After a conservatorship appointment has been made, court investigators regularly interview both the conservator and the conservatee and report to the Court about the well-being of the conservatee and whether the conservatee's estate is being properly managed. Investigators carefully review the accountings submitted at regular intervals by the conservator to ensure that the accountings appear reasonable and accurate and that all disbursements are made exclusively for the benefit of the conservatee.</p>\n\n<h4>Temporary Conservatorships</h4>\n\n<p>On occasion, a temporary conservatorship may be appropriate if there is an emergency that requires an immediate appointment prior to the conservatorship hearing date. A petition for temporary conservatorship must be filed at the same time as the petition for limited or general conservatorship. It may not be filed separately from a general conservatorship. A Petition for Appointment of a Temporary Conservator should have all information supporting the need for emergency orders, including copies of any relevant medical, police, or Adult Protective Services reports.</p>\n\n<h4>Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (LPS) Conservatorships</h4>\n\n<p>LPS conservatorships are established under the Welfare and Institutions code to provide help for persons who are gravely disabled as a result of their mental disability. These conservatees may be a danger to themselves or others. The conservator is responsible for helping to find a placement and mental health treatment for the conservatee who is gravely disabled. An LPS (mental health) conservatorship makes one adult responsible for a mentally ill adult. This type of conservatorship is only for adults with mental illnesses listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).</p>\n\n<p>An LPS conservatorship is only for people who are seriously mentally ill and need special care (usually placement in a locked facility and/or very powerful drugs to control behavior).</p>\n\n<p>An LPS conservatorship is used only when the person needs mental health treatment but cannot or will not accept it voluntarily. Because the person subject to an LPS conservatorship may be placed in a locked facility, there are special protections to ensure that the conservatee's civil rights are protected. <strong>LPS Conservatorships are investigated by the Office of the Public Guardian/Conservato<u>r</u></strong>.<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">\u00a0Guardianships</h3>\n\n<p>Guardianship is a court process in which someone other than a parent is given custody of a child or when a parent or other person is given authority over a child's property. The child, called the \"minor\" or \"ward,\" must be under the age of 18. A legal guardian is an adult the Court chooses to be responsible for and care for a child, manage the child's property, or both. \u00a0\u00a0It differs from adoption in that, among other differences, guardianships may be terminated, guardians may be removed or replaced, and certain restrictions regarding residence are enforced.\u00a0 An adoption is treated as a natural birth with all of the rights of a parent/child relationship.<br>\n<br>\nA guardianship of the estate allows the guardian to make financial decisions for a child, and is often filed when a minor is to receive a large monetary gift or inheritance. Both parents and non-parents can become guardians of the estate for children. In guardianships of the estate, the guardian may be required to obtain a bond or the Court may require the funds to be placed into a blocked account in which withdrawals are allowed only with prior court approval.<br>\n<br>\nThe law requires that the Court conduct an investigation of anyone seeking to become a guardian. A court investigator performs this investigation and there is a fee for this investigation.</p>\n\n<h4>Temporary Guardianship</h4>\n\n<p>Temporary guardianship enables a person to have legal guardianship of a minor prior to the general guardianship hearing. It cannot be filed separately from a guardianship. There must be an urgent need to justify a temporary guardianship.</p>\n\n<h4>Forms</h4>\n\n<p>Guardianship forms are available in the Civil Clerk's Office.

Small Claims court does not report to any credit reporting agency; however, credit agencies check the Court\u2019s records to find judgments and recordings that have an effect on credit ratings.</p>\n\n<p>Also, see <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc100.pdf\" target=\"NEW\">Plaintiff's Claim and Order</a> (page 4 of this form contains Information for the Small Claims Defendant).</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Accordon Item --><!-- Start Accordion Item -->\r\n\r\n<div role=\"tab\" class=\"panel-heading\" id=\"panelacc2849\">\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"panel-title\">\r\n        <a href=\"#acc2849\" role=\"button\" aria-controls=\"acc2849\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"collapsed\">\r\n            My case was taken under submission.

A Writ of Execution is a court order authorizing the sheriff or other officer of the law to carry out the Court\u2019s decision to collect a money judgment.\u00a0 This document tells a law officer to take property of the judgment debtor to pay your claim. The kinds of property an officer may be able to take include: wages, bank accounts, automobiles, and business property or rental income. The Sheriff will charge a fee to execute the writ.\n\n</p><p>If the debtor owns real property, you may want to record an <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej001.pdf\" target=\"NEW\">Abstract of Judgment</a><strong> </strong>to place a lien on the property so that you will be able to be paid if the property is purchased, sold or financed. There is a fee to the Court for issuing an Abstract of Judgment, and the abstract needs to be recorded with the County Recorder in the county where the property is located.

It also recommends that the governor grant you a full pardon. If you are granted a certificate of rehabilitation, the court will send certified copies to the governor. This will serve as an application for a pardon by the governor. A pardon by the governor gives you all the civil and political rights of citizenship, including the right to vote, and, in some cases, the right to own and keep a legal firearm.

Article I, \u00a723 of the California Constitution states: \"a grand jury shall be drawn and summoned at least once a year in each county.\" Depending on a county's population, a specified number of citizens ranging from 11 to 23 in each of California's 58 counties are empowered to investigate and report on various activities of county and city government. The rules governing the makeup, organization, powers and duties of grand juries in California are found in the California Penal Code \u00a7888-939. Recent changes in the Penal Code (\u00a7904.6, 1991) permit any county to have an additional grand jury at the discretion of the presiding judge of the superior court.\n\n</p><p>Qualifications for grand jurors are outlined in Penal Code \u00a7893. This section requires the prospective grand juror be at least 18 years old, in possession of their natural faculties and have sufficient knowledge of the English language. In Tehama County, each grand jury begins its term July 1 and ends its service June 30 of the following year.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">How the Grand Jury is Organized</h3>\n\n<p>The Foreperson is appointed by the Court at the impanelment; the Foreperson facilitates the activities of the Grand Jury. Each Grand Jury decides its own meeting schedule. It meets as a full body and in committees, where the bulk of the work occurs. Each juror is asked to be on two to three committees, and meetings usually occur at least once a month. In addition, jurors meet with county and city officials, and conduct independent reviews on matters of interest or concern. Each committee reports to the full Grand Jury.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusions are reached after study and discussion of the issues and may appear as part of the Grand Jury's final report. To access current Grand Jury Information and Grand Jury Report, please see: <a href=\"http://www.co.tehama.ca.us/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=100\" target=\"NEW\">Tehama County's website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">The Benefits of Being a Grand Juror</h3>\n\n<p>The benefits of being a grand juror are many and individual. There is the satisfaction and pride of doing an important job; there is the experience of being a member of a respected panel, which has the unique authority to see local government workings not available to the regular citizen. Also, it provides an opportunity to make a difference in your community.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Citizen Complaints</h3>\n\n<p>The Grand Jury receives complaints regarding all levels of local government from allegations of misconduct by public officials or employees to inefficiencies in local government. Any citizen may submit a complaint by either completing a Grand Jury Complaint Form or by writing a letter to the Grand Jury. Complaints are treated as confidential. The Tehama County Grand Jury Mailing Address is: P. O. Box 1061, Red Bluff, CA 96080.</p>\n\n<h4>How to File a Complaint</h4>\n\n<p>The Tehama County Grand Jury Complaint Form can be obtained in a variety of ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Via this website - click on the attached link <a href=\"/documents/tehama/GRAND_JURY_COMPLAINT_FORM.doc\">Grand Jury Complaint Form</a></li>\n\t<li>Via email request at: grandjury@tehamacourt.ca.gov</li>\n\t<li>By calling (530) 527-3946 and leaving your name and address for a form to be mailed to you, or a form can be picked up at the Courthouse upon request.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">About the Grand Jury</h3>\n\n<p>The Grand Jury is comprised of 19 members of the community. It is impaneled annually and its term of service is one year. The Grand Jury has a separate and different function than that of a jury and does not hear cases in a courtroom. Instead, jurors review and investigate local governmental activities within Tehama County. The Grand Jury examines county and city governments, schools and special districts to ensure that its duties are lawfully being carried out.</p>\n\n<h4>The Grand Jury is authorized by law to:</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Inquire into the condition and management of public prisons within the county.</li>\n\t<li>Investigate and report on the operations, accounts and records of county officers, departments and their functions.</li>\n\t<li>Inquire into allegations of willful or corrupt misconduct of public officials.</li>\n\t<li>Submit a final report of its findings and recommendations to the Presiding Judge of the Superior Court.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>To be considered for nomination, you must meet the following legal requirements:</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Be a U.S. citizen.</li>\n\t<li>Be at least 18 years old.</li>\n\t<li>Be a resident of Tehama County for at least one year immediately prior to the beginning of your service.</li>\n\t<li>Possess intelligence, sound judgment, and good character.</li>\n\t<li>Have sufficient knowledge of the English language to communicate both orally and in writing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Desirable Attributes:</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Good health</li>\n\t<li>Open-mindedness</li>\n\t<li>Knowledge of and interest in local government and community affairs.</li>\n\t<li>Skill in working productively with others in a group setting where respect and patience are essential</li>\n\t<li>Skill and experience in fact finding, investigative techniques, and report writing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>You CANNOT BE considered for selection if any of the following is true:</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>You are serving as a trial juror in any court in the State of California.</li>\n\t<li>You have served as a Grand Juror in any California court within the previous year.</li>\n\t<li>You have been convicted of malfeasance in office, or any other high crime.</li>\n\t<li>You are serving as an elected public officer.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"doubleBars\">Solicitation/Selection Process</h3>\n\n<p>In April each year, questionnaires are mailed to randomly selected individuals throughout the County. Names and addresses are obtained from the Department of Motor Vehicles and Voter Registration and Elections.
